<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>

<p>If French is, as we have been told, the natural
language of the art of fencing, it seems a
particularly rash venture to translate a French
book on the subject into English. This is
especially the case when the original is such
a work as <i>Les Secrets de l&rsquo;Épée</i>, which so far
from being a dry technical manual, that might
be sufficiently rendered by a baldly literal
version, is one of those fascinating, chatty books,
written in a happy vein, in which the manner of
writing is the matter of principal importance.
But the delightful ease and artful simplicity of
style that captivate the reader are the translator&rsquo;s
despair. I have made the attempt for
my own amusement, and I am publishing my
translation because the original work, which was
first published in 1862 and reprinted in 1875,
has been for some years inaccessible, and because
I think it is a book that will interest English
fencers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span></p>

<p>An interesting and appreciative account of
the book is given in the introduction to the
volume devoted to fencing in the Badminton
Library, together with some criticism of the
author. The would-be fencer is cautioned that
the Baron de Bazancourt is &lsquo;a very expert literary
dodger&rsquo; whose specious arguments must be
studied with the greatest caution. The warning
note is no doubt wise in a book intended for the
English fencer, for English fencing certainly
shows no tendency to be excessively correct, but
is rather inclined to err in the other direction.
But no fencer who reads the work attentively
can fail to derive from it a real profit, and, I
hope, a real pleasure. The keynote of the book
is that a fencer must fence with his &lsquo;head.&rsquo;
Bazancourt generally calls it &lsquo;instinct,&rsquo; or &lsquo;inspiration.&rsquo;
But call it what you will, there can
be no doubt that the continual tax that fencing
makes on the resourcefulness of the player gives
it its subtle and enduring charm. The unforeseen
emergencies that have to be faced, and the
varieties of play that are encountered in meeting
different opponents, make fencing of all sports
the least mechanical and the least monotonous.</p>

<p>We are often told that fencing will never be
popular in England, because it is no longer
required for practical purposes. But does anyone
suppose that we are guided by practical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span>
considerations in choosing our sports? Fencing
is a most exhilarating exercise and one that is
particularly suitable for those of us who live a
town life. A dull day in London may be very
sensibly enlivened by a brisk assault. The
luxury of getting into flannels is increased by
the reflection that for an hour at any rate one
will think of nothing but the foils. For no
exercise is so absorbing as fencing. Whether
you are taking a lesson or are engaged in a
friendly combat your whole attention cannot
fail to be occupied. There is room for nothing
else, and on that account alone fencing must
be commended as a mental relaxation of the
highest value.</p>

<p>Compared with boxing, fencing has the
advantage that it can be continued even into
old age. Now, however willing one may be
to be punched and pommelled, there usually
comes a time when it is inconvenient to appear
in public with a black eye or a bruised cheek.
Few men who take to fencing and master the
preliminary stages can make up their minds to
give it up, until they are obliged to do so for
want of time or opportunity.</p>

<p>The cosmopolitan character of fencing is
another point in its favour. Not only throughout
France and Italy, but wherever French or
Italian is spoken, fencing rooms abound, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
the stranger who visits them is sure to be
received with friendly interest and hospitality.
Fencers are always glad to try conclusions with
a new blade, and a very moderate knowledge
of the art may often serve as a pleasant and
informal introduction in a strange country.</p>

<p>The art of translation is perhaps as slippery
and elusive as the art of fence. <i>L&rsquo;escrime vit
de loyales perfidies</i> says the Baron de Bazancourt.
He might have said the same thing of translation.
I have endeavoured to give a faithful
rendering of this book. It has equally been
my object to make my version readable. I am
conscious of many defects, and cannot hope to
have avoided mistakes, but if I have sometimes
been perfidious, I trust that I have never been
disloyal.</p>

<p>I have to thank many friends for assistance
and advice, and I am especially indebted to
Mr F. H. Townsend for the spirited series
of fencing drawings that accompany the text.</p>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>Why have I written this book? I will
tell you. For of all the subjects that
might have occurred to me, this I am sure is
the last in the world on which I should have
ever dreamed of trespassing. Accident, however,
is apt to take a hand in the most trivial
things of this world as well as in the most
important. It is continually responsible for
the most unlikely events, and it was in fact by
accident that I undertook this work, in which I
have collected and jotted down remarks that are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
entirely my own, concerning an art to which I
have devoted myself for more years than I care
to remember.</p>

<p class="p2">I was staying in the country at an old
manor house belonging to one of my friends.
The litter of autumn, fallen leaves and withering
herbage, was scattered over field and woodland.
This is a favourite season with poets, when
Nature before her winter sleep affects a serene
and melancholy air, that inclines to reverie and
lends wings to fancy. The season also favours
sportsmen. Coverts in which the game has
hitherto found shelter are no longer impenetrable,
and every day the wind robs the poor
persecuted beasts of some fraction of their
shield of verdure. At my friend&rsquo;s house there
were no poets, but there was instead a large
shooting party. We used to take the field after
breakfast, and come home towards dusk, all of
us as tired as a man has a right to be when he
has done six or eight hours&rsquo; walking. After
dinner we invariably adjourned to the smoking
room, and spent the evening in discussing things
in general over our cigars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>One evening&mdash;I quite forget how it came
about&mdash;we found ourselves talking about fencing.
Some one&rsquo;s casual remark, as erratic as the blue
wreaths of smoke that floated vaguely towards
the ceiling, was taken up by some one else, and
led to other remarks, which gradually became
more definite and finally solidified into a conversation.</p>

<p>One can always talk, and one enjoys talking
about a subject in which one is interested. That
is one of the general truths. And as I have
always been devoted to the practice of arms, I
found myself talking at some length and expounding
some views of my own, which I have
tested by practical experience and observation
till they have established themselves in my
mind as axioms.</p>

<p>I was listened to with attention, though there
were few fencers present. And after all the art
of fence does furnish a most interesting fund of
conversation&mdash;the art of skilful fighting at close
quarters, which implies a knowledge of theory
combined with a trained power of execution,
which taxes eye and hand, vigour and judgment,
and brings into play every faculty of mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
and body, each doing its part, and each in turn
supplementing and reinforcing the other.</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Are you aware,&rdquo; said one of my friends,
&ldquo;that these are the secrets of the sword that you
are revealing to us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;those secrets which I
happen to know. But really you have hit upon
the right word, for the secrets of the sword are
innumerable. It is a Proteus in the hand that
orders it, and obeys the least motion of the will
with the quick docility of an attendant spirit.
It can be the insolent and overbearing bully, it
can be the wary and diplomatic courtier. At
one moment it is all menace, a keen attacking
point, the next it changes to a protecting shield.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But alas for our poor faithful servant; to-day
the sword and its secrets are almost forgotten, or
at least but little valued. There was a time,
and a time not so very remote, when a knowledge
of sword-play was considered one of the
credentials of a gentleman. Apply that test
now; apply it to yourselves. We have here in
this room a large number of gentlemen met<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
together, and I do not doubt that each one of
you could make good his title to gentle birth,
and that in more ways than one; and yet how
many of you would be seriously embarrassed if
you were required to manipulate a sword! How
many of you, if you will allow me to say so,
would make but a very pitiful exhibition of
yourselves!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p2">I saw by the smile that went round the room
that my remarks were only too well founded.</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;I know the usual
answer:&mdash;&lsquo;True,&rsquo; you will say, &lsquo;we may be duffers,
but we are not afraid of fighting.&rsquo; Yes, you
are not afraid of fighting, that is to say you are
willing to be killed by the first bully, who
chooses to force a quarrel upon you. Brave
words truly! But after all is it worth while to
be the owner of so many talents, youth and
strength, a cultured mind, a healthy body, and
yet not even to know how to defend your life?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am reminded of the story told of a certain
General. When one of his officers, who disagreed
with him on the policy of some strategic movement,
had said:&mdash;&lsquo;Well, General, when the time
comes I will show you that I know how to die.&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be a fool, Sir,&rsquo; replied the General, &lsquo;your
duty is not to see that you get killed, but to take
care that you don&rsquo;t&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; suggested one of my friends, &ldquo;the
real difficulty is that it takes years of conscientious
and continual application to make
even a moderate fencer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite a mistake, I assure you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, only the other day I happened to
pick up one or two books about fencing and
glanced through them. I assure you, they really
are appalling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There we have it,&rdquo; I exclaimed, &ldquo;and with
that word you go over bag and baggage to the
enemy&rsquo;s camp. You are not the first to be
appalled, merely because the professors have
omitted to caution the reader, that they cannot
in the exercise of their craft afford to be otherwise
than omniscient, and that their omniscience
must be aired. It is because they are afraid of
being taxed with ignorance, or of being rated as
less men than their predecessors, that they insist
on science at any price; science they must have,
interminable and unmitigated science, and so
they produce their laborious treatises, monuments
of erudition, but as you say&mdash;appalling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;For my part, after reading and rereading,
with the most scrupulous attention, everything
that has been written on the subject, I remain
convinced of this, that if I were writing a manual
of fencing my first object would be to get rid of
the alarming jargon of technical terms, which
are supposed to be indispensable&mdash;a formidable
array, quite enough, I freely admit, to give pause
to the most resolute, and to blanch the cheek of
the keenest aspirant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, you are quite right,&rdquo; said my host with
the air of a man who had made the experiment.
&ldquo;How much the art and the professors too
would have gained, if they had only studied
simplicity, and taken the trouble to make themselves
intelligible.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>The conversation, you see, was getting on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;most of the
professors who have committed themselves to
paper have thought otherwise. They plunge
into interminable dissertations on the denomination
of thrusts. They use words which, it is
true, may be found in the dictionary but which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
have an unfamiliar appearance. For instance
they talk about the hand <i>in pronation</i> or <i>in
supination</i>, instead of simply saying the hand
with the nails turned up, or the hand with the
nails turned down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Others have devoted their energy to working
out combinations and classifications of feints,
parries, and ripostes, distinguishing between
them by the nicest shades of difference, and
to devising subtleties of terminology, even going
so far as to compile and exhibit with the pride
of a collector a prodigious catalogue of twelve
thousand five hundred strokes.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> What memory
could possibly contain them?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I, on the contrary, should have spared
no pains to prove that it is perfectly possible to
learn the practical management of the sword
without a superhuman effort, and that sword-play
is worth cultivating as a delightful exercise
and one of the finest kinds of sport.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For unfortunately we have to remember
that Latin, which one uses so seldom, perhaps
once or twice after leaving college, and Greek,
for which one has even less occasion, are considered
useful and even necessary parts of polite
education, but that such things as swimming,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
which may on an emergency be the means of
saving your life, or fencing, which is one of the
most healthy of athletic exercises, the best thing
in the world for developing and bracing a feeble
youngster, and which enables you to defend
yourself if you are challenged by a bully or
assaulted by a blackguard, are reckoned merely
frivolous accomplishments. And it is generally
recognised of course that it is not right to waste
time on mere accomplishments.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mentioned Latin and Greek, which we all
learnt more or less at school. Well, do you
suppose that the man who is going to make
learning his profession carries his studies no
further than the rest of us, however scholarly
some of us may be? No, of course he must
go deeper and examine the remotest bearings
of the particular branch of knowledge, which he
will presently have to teach.</p>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;If you want a still more striking analogy,
take horsemanship. Most men learn to ride,
and can as a matter of fact manage a hack in
the park without making an exhibition of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>selves,
or even join the road-riders when it is a
question of following the hounds. But do you
suppose that the mere man on horseback takes
the trouble to acquire the whole art of horsemanship,
the severe mastery which the professional
requires, the &lsquo;high airs&rsquo; of the school
rider? Does every one study the fundamental
principles, and analyse the nice distinctions,
which go to make the finished equestrian,&mdash;such
a man as the late Mr Astley?</p>

<p>&ldquo;How few there are who attain or pretend to
attain this rare degree of excellence. And yet
they alone can tell you how much perseverance,
how much continual application, and downright
drudgery they have had to go through. For
you may be quite sure that perfect mastery of
any kind whatever can only be the matured
result of extraordinary diligence. Yet you
seldom meet a man who cannot ride tolerably,
and you find that men ride with more or less
grace, or freedom, or vigour, according to their
natural disposition, and gradually perfect their
style, or if you prefer it, unconsciously complete
their education by the growth of habit and
experience. It is just the same with fencing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you would be an accomplished swordsman,
you will certainly require years of hard work,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
close application, and incessant practice. But
do you need this recondite skill? What would
you do with it? You would find it embarrassing.
All that you need as men of leisure, is to be
able to use a sword as you do a horse, for your
amusement, and when you have occasion for it.
And observe I say for your amusement, for no
sport is so attractive for its own sake, or so
engrossing as the practice of arms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are of opinion then,&rdquo; remarked the
Comte de C..., &ldquo;that a man can learn to use a
sword without devoting to it more time and
trouble than he does to riding?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure of it; but don&rsquo;t misunderstand me,
I mean riding in the sense of sticking on. In
fact, without driving the analogy too hard, I
should say that for both exercises a year at the
outside is all that is required to obtain useful and
solid results. And I should add that after a few
months&rsquo; trial you will find that you cannot resist
the fascination that belongs unmistakably to
both these sports. Surely that is not too much
to ask for putting you into good trim, and
teaching you how to protect yourself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, why don&rsquo;t they say so?&rdquo; some one
remarked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I do say so,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;And what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
is more I will make my words good, if one of
these days you care to continue this discussion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was unanimously called upon to keep my
word, and that the next day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, to-morrow then,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I shall
do my best to convince you; but you don&rsquo;t give
me much law.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, with twenty-four hours&rsquo; notice?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something in that&mdash;I will sleep upon
it&mdash;and so&mdash;good-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p2">That is the true history of the making of
this book. The following chapters are the
record of our conversations, which I have simply
put into shape and revised.</p>

<p>The next day after dinner we all reassembled
in the smoking-room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said my host, &ldquo;your audience you
see is complete, our cigars are alight, and we are
ready to give you our best attention.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;you will understand
that I have no intention of inflicting upon you
a course of instruction. As far as that goes,
the books, especially the two that have appeared
most recently, by Professors Gomard and Grisier,
have said all that is worth saying, and in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
judgment perhaps a great deal more. They give
too much good advice, too many excellent rules,
too many excellent maxims, too many thrusts,
feints, parries, ripostes, counter-ripostes, and so
forth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very far from holding with the received
doctrine of the necessity or the importance of a
great variety of play. I believe that the effectiveness
of a skilful fencer depends on the
correctness of his inferences, on the alertness
and nicety of his judgment, on quickness of
hand and precision of movement, whether in
attack, parry, or riposte, rather than on a very
varied play, which necessitates a much more
elaborate training, and so far from being of
any real use serves only to perplex the mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The alphabet of fencing, if you will allow
the expression, is as fixed and immutable as
any other alphabet. Its characters are ascertained
and definite motions, which are combined in
accordance with the structure and balance of
our organism, the natural action of the muscles,
and the flexibility possible to the limbs and
body. I do not set up for a schoolmaster, and
shall not attempt to teach you this alphabet.
I assume that you are already acquainted with
it. All that I shall do, or at all events try to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
do, is to discuss the theoretical principles, for
apart from them the material factors are only so
much dull and senseless machinery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall try to keep within bounds, and to
advance a few simple arguments, to convince
you that swordsmanship is neither so slow nor
so perplexing as you are inclined to suppose.
Above all, I hope you will not allow me to
forget that this is a conversation. Remember
that you are at liberty to make any remarks
that occur to you. That is part of the bargain.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p2">Several of my friends assured me that I need
have no anxiety; they did not mean to let me
off too easily.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;To begin then; my first object will be to
make my meaning perfectly plain. The thing
to do will be to take fencing in its broad outlines.
It would be labour thrown away to enter the
bewildering labyrinth of those interminable
details, which after all are nothing more than
the mathematical extension of elementary principles,
which may be continued to infinity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fencing in its infancy had to feel its way;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
its methods were yet to be found, its possibilities
to be explored. Little by little, as one period
succeeded another and the art became in many
respects perfected, changes were introduced, and
especially changes that tended to greater simplicity.
Old theories became old fashioned and
were thrown aside to make room for new
doctrines.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fencing, in fact, was developed like most
other things. But we must not lose sight of
the fact that the early methods of the old
masters, both in Italy and France, date from
the sixteenth or seventeenth century, and that
the weapons employed in those days differed
materially from ours in shape, weight, and
function. The change of weapon has naturally
led to a change of method.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would doubtless be interesting to the
antiquary to trace the successive changes that
have taken place in sword-play, and to compare
it as it exists to-day with what it was in 1536,
when Marozzo wrote his treatise on the sword.
(Pray excuse my erudition.) The sword of that
period was a wide straight blade with two cutting
edges. I need not say that Marozzo was Italian.
The first French work on the subject was, I
believe, a treatise by Henri de Saint-Didier,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
which was published in 1573, and dedicated
to Charles IX. At that time France was a
long way behind Italy, where for twenty years
already the edge had been abandoned for the
point.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not my intention to retrace the abstruse
history of the development of swordsmanship;
such an inquiry would, however, prove that in
all ages the new truths were invariably denied
before they established themselves as accomplished
facts. There is no need then, as you
will doubtless be relieved to hear, to discuss the
systems of antiquity; we will pass over the
intervening periods without further preface, and
come down at once to modern times.</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;We are told to draw a hard and fast line
between two schools,&mdash;probably for the convenience
of putting ourselves in the right and
our opponents in the wrong.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For my own part, and speaking seriously,
I fail to recognise more than one. True, that
one may be regarded from several points of
view. I can distinguish three very clearly, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
these different aspects are very far from being
distinct in the sense of clearly defined natural
orders. I will describe three kinds of play, which
are adopted by fencers according to fancy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first is fencing regarded as a graceful
athletic exercise, contrived very much on the
lines of a ceremonious dance, the interlacing
movements of the combatants, as they close
and fall back to their original positions, recalling
the figures of a quadrille. One might almost
say that the simplest example of this method
is the single combat of melodrama, the stage
duel with its concerted movements, and that
it finds its most perfect expression, or, if you
prefer the phrase, attains its object in the
execution of a series of <i>voltes</i> and <i>passes</i> or
dodgy side-steps, a complicated succession of
attacks, parries, and ripostes, skilfully delivered,
and brought off strictly in accordance with
prescribed regulations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The second is fencing conceived as an exact
science. Here it is &lsquo;the noble art&rsquo; that calls for
profound study and arduous research. The
student must explore its truths and consider
them in all their bearings, pursue theory to its
remotest ramifications, and drag to light its most
reluctant secrets. Solid hard work and assiduous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
application, such as science always demands of
her votaries, backed by physical and intellectual
resources naturally fitted to the task, are the only
means which will enable you to achieve this
consummate skill, the highest degree of attainment
in the art. You will not be surprised
when I say that the annals of the sword record
but few names of undisputed preeminence, new
stars that mark the epochs in its history.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The third is fencing considered from the
point of view of practical self-defence. In this
case the method is fashioned, so to speak, by
personal inspiration, and is impressed with the
stamp of individual character. This is the real
thing, battle in deadly earnest, complete with all
the terrors and sudden crises of warfare. Instead
of passes ingeniously complicated, and foiled
by parries as scientifically elaborate, steel clashes
with steel, intent on forcing somewhere a passage
for the point. The game becomes a fight, and
a fight all the more grim, because the fighting
animal is reinforced by science, and chooses
from her armoury the weapons that make him
strong, rejecting whatever is cumbrous or likely
to obscure his &lsquo;native hue of resolution.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We now see the difference between the two
styles,&mdash;call them schools if you like. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
wishes to preserve intact and unalloyed the
ancient academical traditions,&mdash;I had almost
called them the traditions of the dancing
master,&mdash;while the other inclines to what
nowadays we call realism. Is that a gain or
a loss? At the present time everything tends
to realism, but we are not, so far as I know,
obliged to admit that the dream is the type
of perfect beauty, and the real the type of all
that is ugly and bad. We live in a practical
age, perhaps too practical. Sometimes one may
regret that it is so; but what other result could
you expect to follow from the convulsions that
have so frequently shattered it? The ideal,
scared by the noise and confusion of our revolutions,
so often repeated, so seldom foreseen,
has used its wings to some purpose, and taken
flight to a world far removed from ours.</p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;You will tell me that my comment is too
grave for my text, but you know as well as I do
that small things and great are linked together
by bonds, which may be invisible but are none
the less real.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Every age,&rdquo; remarked one of my friends,
&ldquo;has its own manners and customs. We no
longer live in the days when every gentleman
carried a sword at his side and as a matter of
course knew how to use it. The taste for
fencing is not so universal that we are all
impatient to be initiated into its inmost mysteries.
Some of us may not have sufficient
leisure or sufficient inclination; we are too busy
or too lazy. I believe that what most men
think about it can be put in a very few words:&mdash;&lsquo;<i>We
don&rsquo;t want to fight but</i>&mdash;if we must, we
should like to be able to show our teeth and
fight like gentlemen,&rsquo; that is all that the average
man wants with fencing.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;Quite right,&rdquo; chimed in the Vicomte de G.
with a laugh, &ldquo;we only want just so much of it
as will serve our private ends.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;All that you say,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;is true, but
it is not the whole truth, as you would readily
admit if you paid a visit to one of the fencing
rooms of Paris. If you happened, for instance,
to drop in on my friend and esteemed master,
M. Pons, you would find a gathering of amateurs,
who are devoted to the practice of arms, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
keep up the traditions with taste and culture,
and understand thoroughly well how a sword
ought to be used.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, to be quite fair, I must hasten to add
that the prowess and prestige of these brilliant
players would not suffer by the simplification
of sword-play. The point I wish to make is
that a treatise on fencing for the use of gentlemen,
who have so little time to spare and so
much to waste, is a book to be written, a book
of real utility and importance, and indeed almost
indispensable. I have put my finger on a felt
want, and if you will allow me I will briefly
explain how I think such a book ought to be
written, and what it ought to teach. I know,
of course, that I shall be violently contradicted,
but after all&mdash;I know that I am on the right
track.</p>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;I have told you that we are asked to make
an absolute distinction between two schools of
fencing. Obviously it is the new school that
is wrong, and, as I happen to belong to that
school, you must give me leave to defend it, or,
at all events, to explain its tendencies logically,
theoretically, and practically.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;Take care, Sir,&rdquo; a voice was heard to
remark, &ldquo;those three words are decidedly appalling.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;they are not
so formidable as they seem at first sight. You
will find that if we thresh out the general
principles, what I have to say presently will
be much simplified and easier to follow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You often hear men say: &lsquo;There is no
pretty fencing nowadays. It has relapsed into
its primitive brutality.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; I should answer, &ldquo;it has come
back to its proper object. For consider,&mdash;an
exercise, an art which starts with the fundamental
idea of a fight between two men who
are thirsting for each other&rsquo;s blood, cannot be
regarded as a mere amusement, or as an academical
study in civility and good manners.
One might argue with some effect, that to
sacrifice the first essential principle of the art
to superior refinements, which were really too
exclusive, was a risky game to play, and that,
sooner or later, the players were sure to discover
that fact to their cost. Now I should maintain
that the revolution, which has been brought
about, is a clear advance, and only brutal, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
you will have it so, because it is the assertion
of the brutal truth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With the exception of the few who have
the ambition to make themselves accomplished
swordsmen, men you meet in the fencing room
do not as a rule come there to sit at the feet
of the professor, and imbibe the mystic lore of
scientific theory which he expounds, but rather
to be drilled and disciplined in the practical use
of the sword which he holds in his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As a young man I was passionately fond of
fencing; I worked at it with enthusiasm; my
diligence and devotion were untiring. Among
my contemporaries were several very strong
amateurs, really skilful swordsmen, experts
worthy of the best days and most glorious
traditions of the sword. I am thinking of
such men as Ambert, Caccia, Choquet, Lord
Seymour, the Marquis de l&rsquo;Angle and others,
a group of amateurs well able to hold their own
with the most skilful masters. I believe that at
that time, and I give you this as my sincere
conviction, fencing reached as high a level as
at any period in its history.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;It was the opening of a new era. Hitherto
the art had advanced along a narrow track.
Now the old ways suddenly broadened out.
Old methods were superseded. Fencing was
no longer treated as an academical accomplishment,
a graceful exercise in courtly skill and
bearing, from which originality was barred. It
had become something more than the glib
repetition of set phrases, that had been got by
heart from a book and carefully rehearsed.
The new movement, as it may well be called,
though it abandoned the perfect manner, which
had grown too perfect, brought our elusive art
back to regions less celestial, I readily admit,
but at the same time brought it face to face
with other than imaginary difficulties.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The art received a new impetus. &lsquo;Natural
fighters,&rsquo; men equipped with abundant energy
and assurance, who were convinced that all that
was necessary for self-defence was a general
athletic training such as they possessed, called
the fencer&rsquo;s skill in question. Regarded as
fencing their style may have been faulty, not
to say atrocious, but they confronted the fencer
with this logical dilemma:&mdash;&lsquo;You are a master<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
of the sword or an accomplished amateur, I, on
the other hand, know nothing about it. Hit
me and do not let me hit you. That is all I
ask. I shall fight by the light of nature and
do what I can; you will be strictly scientific
and keep to your rules.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;To my mind the only way to silence an
opponent of this sort was to take sword in hand,
and literally demonstrate to him that he was
equally ignorant and incapable. This course,
however, did not commend itself to others, who
were content to fight this modern hydra, which
reappeared every day in some new shape, with&mdash;contempt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The professors gnashed their teeth and
swore, though a few of them kept their temper:&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Is our Art then,&rsquo; they declaimed, &lsquo;a mere
delusion, a fallen idol? Are we to prostitute
and expose it to the barbarous excesses of a
brutal and ignorant mob? Are we to join in
an outlandish Babel, where every one claims to
be heard in his own tongue, some jargon which
no one can understand?&rsquo;</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;There certainly was something in this line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
of argument, however magisterially it might be
stated. But at the same time it was impossible
to deny that there was, wrapped up in these
ungainly eccentricities, a real truth, which could
not be entirely neglected. For among the noisy
crowd, who would have liked to set their fads
upon a pinnacle, one found fencers of experience,
men who by long training and the use of scientific
method had acquired sound judgment and
thorough workmanship. These men, it is true,
had the courage to trample on the ancient
superstitions, and gladly welcomed the widening
of the field, which would give ample room, and
scope for every kind of bias.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was clearly a revolution, and declared
itself by the unmistakable signs of all revolutions,
by its aggressive attitude and by its
onslaught on old ideas and traditions, which
till then had been thought unassailable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Molière&rsquo;s famous maxim,&mdash;&lsquo;Hit and don&rsquo;t be
hit back,&rsquo;&mdash;asserted itself triumphantly. Truth
and falsehood went hand in hand. The thing
to be done was to winnow the chaff from the
corn, and not reject the whole as worthless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Well, let us now see if we can sum up the
real changes which the new school introduced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As a matter of fact it proposed absolutely
none that was unreasonable. Its tenets amounted
to this:&mdash;&lsquo;A fencer must be judged not so
much by his graceful attitude and classical style,
not so much by his masterly command of precise
execution, as by his power of quickly conceiving
and quickly delivering the right attack at the
right moment.</p>

<p>&lsquo;When once a beginner has learnt the rudiments
of sword-play; when he has learnt that
the movements of hand and body must correspond,
and maintain an even balance in every
position; that the wrist must be quick to follow
the adverse blade and form a close parry, without
flying wild and wide in uncontrolled disorder;
when he can appreciate the value of a step to
the rear and the value of a step to the front;
when he has grasped the danger to which he is
exposed in making a complicated attack, and
realises that the effectiveness of a simple attack
depends on the power of seizing the critical
moment,&mdash;then he should be left to follow his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
natural instinct, and allowed to exercise his own
judgment in making use of the knowledge he
has acquired.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;You should not say to him:&mdash;&lsquo;We must
now describe an exact circle, beyond which, by
thought, word, or deed, you must not budge.
You find it a more natural position, and easier
for attack and riposte, to lean your body forward
and double yourself up. It cannot be helped,
you are required to keep the body upright by
the rules of classical fencing.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You prefer to keep out of distance, because
you find that at close quarters your nervous
dread of a surprise attack or of a quick thrust
is disconcerting and disturbs your equanimity.
You must not keep out of distance. You are
required to keep the prescribed distance and to
join blades.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You are afraid of attacks on the sword, such
as beats, binds, and pressures, or of surprise
attacks, and to avoid them you refuse to engage
your adversary&rsquo;s blade. You must not refuse.
You are required to engage swords by the rules
of the game; only bad fencers attempt to avoid
the engagement.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You attack in the low lines, perhaps you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
hit your opponent below the belt. Quite true,
the hit would be fatal in a duel, but in sword-play
it is considered a foul blow; the code does
not allow it, therefore the hit is bad.&rsquo;</p>

<h3>VIII.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;This sort of thing is mistaken prejudice.
The assault ought to be a sham fight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It follows that everyone should have liberty
of action. Do not attempt to force A. to be
graceful and elegant, if he is not built that way.
Permit B. to develope his own style in his own
fashion, and do not try to make him a servile
copy of yourself, merely for the sake of emphasising
your superiority. If he makes mistakes,
take advantage of them, that is the most convincing
kind of correction. If his play is
dangerous but incorrect, show him that you
can be at once correct and dangerous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In short we ask for a fair field and no
favour for every sort of style and theory that
is based on a study of the weapon. Science
you know is the result of intelligent application.
Do you seriously believe that these fencers are
devoid of science, because they refuse to be
judged by your standard, or because they try<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
to obtain new results, where you persist in seeing
nothing but annoying tricks?</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;You must allow one of two things. Either
the methods which these fencers employ, their
plans of attack and defence, are based on policy
and their knowledge of the weapon, and their
source of inspiration is the same as yours; in
that case they are justified by results, they have
teeth and can bite, and are not the easy prey,
which you expected to find them. Or on the
contrary, they go to work without judgment,
they let fly at random, and advance or retire
without any notion of time or distance, their
parries are wide and weak, without any sense of
touch, their attacks uncertain, wild and incoherent.
In that case they are not dangerous.
Chance may perhaps protect them once, but you
with your experience and skill of course will
easily defeat them, and their slap-dash play will
lead them promptly into every trap which you
choose to set for them.</p>

<h3>IX.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Such is the controversy, the great quarrel
between the two schools, the feud between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
white rose and the red. I have attempted to
explain it to you in its general outlines as
clearly as I possibly could. You will find it
easier to understand the details, which we shall
consider when we continue this discussion.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;What will your subject be to-morrow?&rdquo;
asked my host.</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;I really cannot say,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;It would be
difficult to lay down a regular plan. No doubt
something will turn up to talk about. And, by
the way, this morning I noticed in the library
one or two old books about sword-play, and I
shall try to find time to turn them over.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>It began to dawn upon me that my undertaking
was more serious than I had
anticipated, and that I had let myself in for
some uncommonly hard work; for I should
have to advance solid reasons in support of
the theories that I had so rashly propounded.
I had committed myself to nothing less than
the exposition of a system to men who, for
the most part, knew nothing at all about sword-play,
and could not be expected to understand
the meaning of the technical terms. I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
have to be clear and precise and ready to answer
any questions that might be put to me.</p>

<p>I was particularly anxious to carry my little
audience with me, because I venture to think
that no gentleman&rsquo;s education is complete without
some knowledge of fencing, and I consider that
parents and guardians are much to blame if they
fail to recognise the two-fold importance of this
indispensable exercise, which not only strengthens
and developes the learner&rsquo;s body, but also insures
his life.</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; I exclaimed, as I joined the company
in the smoking-room, where we met every
evening, &ldquo;my audience I see is before me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have kept your audience waiting,&rdquo; said
my host, &ldquo;and we have kept an armchair waiting
for you. Sit down, and begin as soon as you
please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; I replied sitting down,&mdash;&ldquo;I will
begin at once.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;I remarked, yesterday, that the art of fencing
would greatly benefit by simplification, and that
it does not require such formidable and protracted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
study as some of the text-books by their elaborate
display of intricate and interminable combinations
would lead you to suppose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The elementary principles of sword-play are
four in number. They are these:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><div class="ilb">

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;My classification, you see, is not very complicated.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;But,&rdquo; some one objected, &ldquo;you are surely
forgetting to name an immense number of strokes
and parries; for it is impossible that the long
lists of names, which are given in the books, and
the directions for the various passes, which have
the air of cabalistic formulae and are about
equally intelligible, can be reduced to such
simple terms.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;I am willing to forget them,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;in
fact more than willing, for I am convinced that
they only serve to distract the learner&rsquo;s mind. The
simpler the principles, the simpler the practice.
Give him fewer things to do, and he will do them
more easily, and he will certainly learn to do
them in a shorter time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have always said that a text-book of
fencing, which contained nothing that was
superfluous, would not fill a volume but might
be written out on a sheet of notepaper, and
besides, I would have you notice that several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
of the attacks, parries, and ripostes included
in my list might logically have been omitted,
because they are simply different ways of
executing the same movement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For instance, what I have called &ldquo;<i>One, two</i>&rdquo; is the combination of two <i>disengagements</i>, one
delivered in quarte, the other in tierce. The <i>beat
straight thrust</i> is the combination of a <i>beat</i> on
the sword with a <i>straight thrust</i>. The <i>beat
disengage</i> is simply a <i>beat</i> followed by a <i>disengagement</i>.
<i>Feint cut-over</i>, <i>feint disengage</i> are
in like manner the different methods, which are
most commonly used, of executing the <i>straight
thrust</i> or the <i>disengagement</i>, the two fundamental
strokes of sword-play.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even the <i>cut-over</i> is really a sort of <i>disengagement</i>,
since it starts from the same position,
is aimed at the same point, and may be met by
the same parries. The only difference is that
the <i>disengagement</i> passes under the blade, while
the <i>cut-over</i> passes over the point. The <i>cut-over
and disengage in quarte</i> is the same movement as
<i>counter-quarte</i>, conceived and executed in the one
case as an attack, in the other as a parry. <i>Cut-over
and disengage in tierce</i> is related in precisely
the same way to <i>counter-tierce</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, then, that the multiplication of
strokes, far from extending to infinity, may be
reduced to very narrow limits. And I am firmly
convinced, that if you transgress these limits you
are at once involved in endless confusion, which
you ought to be very careful to avoid.&mdash;You
will, I am sure, admit the force of my argument.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The attacks and parries which I have
described traverse all the lines which are open
to the passage of the sword, that is to say <i>the
high and low lines, the inside lines and the outside</i>.
The fencer whose mind is set free from the
perplexity of parries complete and parries
intermediate and so forth, understands more
clearly the materials that are available for his
combinations, and the measures that he must
take to meet the adverse attack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The lucidity of his mind is reflected even
in the movement of his hand which goes straight
to its mark without hesitation or confusion.
Speed and freedom of delivery follow as a
matter of course. And we must not forget
that quickness of hand, combined with what
may be called fencing judgment, is of all
qualifications the most important, the most
necessary, the most vitally indispensable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;We may as well follow up the turn our
conversation has taken, and pass under review
without further preface the three watch-words of
swordsmanship:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center smcap spaced large">Judgment Control Speed.</p>

<p>The man who should master these three
would be the pattern of the perfect fencer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what of fencing judgment? Why in
the world should you be afraid of it, as though
it were the hundred-headed hydra that guards
the sacred portals? What is it but that part
of the understanding that we all bring to bear
on the conduct of everyday life? Nothing in
human affairs however trivial or however great
can be done without it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fencing judgment implies more especially
distrust, cunning, a wise caution, the power of
interpreting the dumb language of the sword,
the faculty of drawing correct inferences. These
faculties are in the first instance directly stimulated
by the master&rsquo;s lessons, and natural
intelligence, acting without any conscious effort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
on your part, combined with experience, will
make the good seed grow. Do not concern
yourself about it. Over-anxiety always has a
most disturbing effect on the mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The other night when I spoke of the
alphabet of fencing, I had a special object in
view. There is a language of the sword, by
which questions are asked and answered. As
soon as you have learnt the words you can speak
and understand it. To admit that it is necessary
to make a separate study of every possible
phrase implies that a simple and straightforward
method of instruction, which I hold to be of the
highest importance, is unattainable.</p>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;In like manner the faculty of control is a
thing that may be gradually acquired by practice.
It is the result of imparting a supple &lsquo;temper&rsquo;
to the wrist and body, and consists in the
knitting up of the various operations into one
continuous movement. But, as in the case of
fencing judgment, so here, the desired result<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
cannot be obtained all at once. It is the first
and most natural consequence of your master&rsquo;s
instructions. It comes of daily practice and you
must patiently watch and wait for it, as you
might wait for a peach slowly ripening on a
sunny wall. Let it grow upon you like a
habit, by slow degrees, till it becomes a second
nature.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speed, not of course mere quickness of
hand, but the rapid execution of every movement,
is one of the fencer&rsquo;s great resources,
whether in attack, parry, or retreat. It is to
my mind the main point to be insisted on from
the very first.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And, accordingly, I think that the master
should be careful not to overdo the sort of
teaching, that consists in delivering a running
commentary such as this:&mdash;&lsquo;Steady now: not
too fast: take your time about it: think what
you are doing: keep your hand in order: mark
each motion: at the word <i>one</i>,&mdash;and so forth:
don&rsquo;t hurry, you will go fast enough by and by.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is certainly useful to practise the hand
by exercising it on the master&rsquo;s jacket, but it is
useless to practise it by slow movements. First
explain how the stroke is to be executed, and then
without more ado make your pupil get into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
way of taking it quickly. Slowness is convenient,
because it renders execution easy, but the ease
of execution that is derived from it is dangerous,
because it reacts on the judgment and accustoms
the mind to lazy ways. Your object is, no doubt,
to bring the hand under control and analyse the
stroke in detail, but if the result of your teaching
is that your pupil falls into a sluggish habit you
are sowing the seeds of a vice, which you will
probably never succeed in extirpating.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose you are teaching a child to walk,
you are not surprised that his first steps are
wavering and unsteady, and that he cannot
plant his feeble feet firmly on the ground. You
hold him up, but you let him walk. In due
time he learns to use his strength, as a bird
learns to fly. The young fencer is the child
learning to walk. As his knowledge and experience
gradually expand, many faults will
disappear of themselves, or will be more easily
seen and corrected by his maturer judgment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speed is a mechanical force, unreasoning,
unconscious, but a force capable of development.
You must add fuel to the fire and not allow it
to go out. Do you suppose that all you have
to do is to change the word of command:&mdash;&lsquo;Now
do quickly what you have done slowly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
hitherto&rsquo;? Your new command introduces a
new idea and creates new difficulties.</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;Such, speaking generally, are the essential
principles of fencing. I cannot say whether I
have succeeded in showing you clearly how
simple the lesson on these lines may be made,
or how far I have been able to reassure those,
who have inadvertently opened a treatise on
sword-play and have fought shy of the subject
ever since, but I am convinced that a course of
instruction such as I suggest would produce
very good results.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To explain myself more fully, as I am
talking among friends and there are no professors
present, I will go on to tell you briefly
how I should set about teaching the use of the
sword.</p>

<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;I should expect my scholar during the first
month to give up <i>half an hour a day</i> to foil
practice, and after that to keep it up <i>three times
a week</i>. My first lesson would be devoted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
showing him theoretically and practically the
vital importance of establishing a perfect concert
or balance between the various movements.
This is the fundamental principle of all athletic
exercises, and applies equally to riding, swimming,
gymnastics, and to fencing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should make him advance and retire,
lunge and recover, taking care not to lose his
balance. This first lesson is sufficient to enable
the least intelligent to understand the mechanism
of the different movements, which are based on
the natural and instinctive faculties of the human
body.</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;Come, C&mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo; I said, rising from my chair,
&ldquo;unless I am mistaken, you have never attempted
to fence. Will you allow me to make
use of you by way of illustration?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall be delighted,&rdquo; replied C&mdash;&mdash;, &ldquo;but I
shall be very awkward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you will be for the first five
minutes. It is the common lot from which no
one can escape. Now place yourself &lsquo;On guard&rsquo;;
the words explain themselves:&mdash;to be on guard,
to protect yourself, that is to say to hold yourself
equally ready for attack or defence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bend your legs. Let me use an expression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
which is perhaps incorrect but which explains
my meaning clearly:&mdash;Sit well down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your right arm must be half extended.
As a general rule the wrist should be at the
height of the breast. You will be able later to
modify these elementary studies, by adapting
them to suit the position which comes to you
most naturally. The important thing is to
acquire an uncramped easy style, and to keep
the body evenly balanced. In this position the
sword can most easily traverse the various
openings that are offered to it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I advance on you. In order to get back
and always keep your distance you have only
to carry the left foot to the rear, and let the
right foot follow it immediately. To advance
on me, simply reverse these movements. Bring
the right foot forward and follow it up with the
left.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bravo! you advance like a professor. See
that you keep your legs bent and the body
upright, so as to be always ready for advance or
retreat. If you cannot avoid stooping, lean
forward rather than backward. By carrying the
body forward you are no more exposed than
you were before; for the body by its inclined
position protects itself, presents a smaller sur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>face,
and makes it more difficult for your
opponent to fix his point, when he might otherwise
hit you; but if you throw the body back,
you lose the power of making a quick attack
and a quick riposte. Are you tired?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good! That shows that your position is
correct, and that it does not cramp your muscles
or paralyse any of your movements. You
understand, of course, that by standing sideways
you present a smaller target to your adversary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So much for defence. Now, for the attack.</p>

<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;In order to attack, you lunge, by carrying
the right leg smartly forward and straightening
the left, so as to give the body its full extension.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever the attack may be, whether
simple or composite, the movements of the
hand must be completed and the arm absolutely
straight, before the lunge is made, though the
different movements must follow each other
without the least interval.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It is equally important to remember that
the recovery must be as smart as the attack.
The great danger of the attack is that it should
be too intemperate, for a too intemperate attack
leaves you exposed to danger, without strength
or speed to escape.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;But,&rdquo; some one asked, &ldquo;is it really necessary
when you are on guard, to arrange the left arm
above the head in a graceful curve, and then
swing it down to the leg as you lunge?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;The graceful curve is not an absolute necessity.
Place the arm behind your back if you
prefer to do so, for if you bring it to the front
you drag forward the left shoulder, and thereby
expose a larger target to your opponent&rsquo;s point.
The arm, you see, acts the part of a rope-walker&rsquo;s
balancing pole. It steadies the movements and
balances the weight of the body. Since you
have a spare arm you must place it somewhere,
and if you consider you will see that it is least
in the way where I have placed it. It serves a
useful purpose in the general arrangement,&mdash;that
is the only object of the position. I need
not refine the point further.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In fencing, the movements of the body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
and limbs are of great importance. All the
mechanical part of sword-play depends on the
principles which I have just explained. I have
now taken the mechanism to pieces and shown
you how it is put together.</p>

<h3>VIII.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;One word more. What was the reason for
choosing this attitude and these movements?</p>

<p>&ldquo;They were chosen because they are natural
and instinctive. Instinct dictated the rule, which
is based on experience, on practical necessity, on
correct principle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the object to be attained?</p>

<p>&ldquo;First, for defence, to allow the limbs their
complete liberty of action, their natural elasticity
and easy play; secondly for attack, to give
the extension of the body its full force.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now try to change the position; straighten
your legs; you will at once notice the increased
difficulty of executing the different movements,
whether of attack, defence, or retreat. You lose
your balance, and the lunge either precedes the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
action of the hand and the extension of the arm,
or follows those movements too late.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The legs are springs which support the
body and determine its most rapid movements.
If you are out shooting and want to jump a
ditch, you bend your legs in order to obtain the
necessary spring. Or again, if you jump down
from a height, you bend your legs at the moment
your feet touch the ground; if you do not, your
whole body is jarred.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dwell on this point in order to convince
you of its absolute necessity, and to make you
understand clearly the why and wherefore of the
position. But, I repeat, instinct was the first
teacher, experience came later and has only
confirmed the principle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One last caution. When once you have
learnt by practice how to harmonise your movements,
and have realised how great a power at
a given moment the faculty of making these
movements with ease and rapidity may be, then,
and not till then, venture to take your personal
inclination into account. And if after carefully
weighing the pros and cons you come to the
conclusion that you can, owing to some personal
peculiarity, improve upon the elementary rules
of the lesson, do not hesitate to depart from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
them without scruple, but never without good
reason. The best position is that which allows
you complete freedom and perfect balance. But
never forget that all exaggeration is bad, and
that nothing can be worse than the exaggeration
of an ungraceful and ungainly style. That is all
I have to say this evening.&rdquo;</p>

</div>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;We will continue the course of instruction
of which you have studied at present
only the first page; I am going into very
minute detail, as you see.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our scholar now knows the different positions,
and can appreciate why they are to be
commended, and what is to be gained by
adopting them. At the next lesson,&mdash;and each
lesson would consist of not more than three
bouts of eight or ten minutes each,&mdash;I should
show him and make him execute the simple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
attacks and the simple parries:&mdash;<i>Disengagements
in tierce and quarte, straight thrusts, the cut over,
and parries of quarte and tierce.</i> The attacks
will exercise him in the lunge, the parries will
improve the flexibility of his wrist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should make him continually retire and
advance. I should, even at this early stage,
take pains to secure a certain degree of life and
speed in his execution, and I should be careful
to vary the exercises, and never appeal to his
intelligence at the risk of checking the activity
of his movements. Sluggishness, I repeat, is a
deadly foe, against which every avenue must be
closed from the very first.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Next I should go on to composite parries
and composite attacks. I have already named
them, and you remember that they are not very
numerous. <i>Counters</i>, <i>double counters</i>, and combinations
of the <i>cut over</i> and <i>disengagement</i> are
the most useful things to practise, because they
work the wrist in every direction, and make it
both quick and supple.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Although a great many instructors would
say that I am wrong, I should make it my
principal aim to form and cultivate a habit of
executing all movements at speed. I should
insist less on precision of control than on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
smartness of execution, and at the same time
I should call my pupil&rsquo;s attention to the
mistakes which he must be most careful to
avoid, and to the points of danger where he
must exercise the greatest caution.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should practise him in retiring quickly,
and should make him deliver simple attacks on
the march, keeping his blade in position. After
a few lessons I should repeatedly place my
button on his jacket, if he did not parry quickly
enough, or if he was slow on the recovery. In
a word I should put plenty of life and go into
my lessons from the first, and not allow them to
become tedious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After every lesson I should direct his
serious attention to the principal faults I had
noticed, and I should make him understand the
dangers to which these faults must inevitably
expose him. For instance, if he caught the
fatal trick of dropping or drawing back his
hand, I should take care to make him attack
and riposte in the high lines, in order to get
him to carry his wrist high, and vice versa. In
this way I should exercise his judgment by
making him think, and his hand and body by
keeping him closely to his work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Above all, the master&rsquo;s lesson must not
lose itself in a maze of attacks and parries and
ripostes, which in some treatises are as numerous
and interminable as the stars of heaven. The
strict limitation of the number of strokes to be
taught renders their execution proportionately
easier, and makes a clear impression on the
mind. Experience and fencing instinct teach,
far better than any lesson, certain niceties, which
give life and finish and character to the play.
There you have the lesson complete.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As the scholar gradually grows stronger,
he learns to hold himself correctly, and acquires
ease. He understands what to do without being
told, and his hand is in a fair way to become
the faithful echo of his thought.</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;We here touch on another point, where I
find myself at variance with nearly all the
professional instructors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I have read in the books which deal with
this subject of &lsquo;the danger of premature loose
play.&rsquo; &lsquo;You run the risk,&rsquo; say some, &lsquo;of spoiling
a promising pupil, and of arresting his future
progress, just when he is beginning to form good
habits.&rsquo; Others go further and declare that:
&lsquo;The instructor who allows his pupil to commence
loose play too soon sacrifices by an act
of fatal indulgence the whole future of fencing.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not agree with this view. I cannot
even see that it logically applies to those who
mean to devote all their time to the study of
sword-play, and who are prepared to make a
determined effort to reach the topmost summit
of this difficult art. Much less, then, to my
mind, is it applicable to the generality of men,
who have no ambition to become such learned
fencers, as we were saying the other evening.
The professors wilfully refuse to see this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yet of all arts, the art of fencing may
be considered from the most widely different
standpoints, and particularly may be approached
with very varied degrees of knowledge and
application. Is it so very certain that &lsquo;premature
loose play,&rsquo; as the professors love to call
it, is so pernicious as they think,&mdash;the bad seed
that cannot fail to produce an evil crop of vices?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
Right or wrong, I can only say once more that
I am of quite the contrary opinion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fail to see that it is dangerous for a pupil
to attempt the assault, when he has learnt by
taking lessons for a month,&mdash;more or less,
according to the progress made and his natural
capacity,&mdash;to understand the various strokes I
have described, and can already execute them
with some degree of liveliness and control.</p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I am quite ready to admit that
his first assaults, like all first attempts that
require a trained habit of mind, cannot be free
from mistakes, exaggerations, faults of all sorts.
But is not the master there to correct these
errors with his lesson, and to bring his pupil,
who is inclined to go astray, back to the right
path? Cannot the leading strings be readjusted?</p>

<p>&ldquo;The very fact that the master has had an
opportunity of observing the mistakes, to which
his pupil is most liable, when left to himself,
enables him to devote all his care to overcome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
and correct them by both practice and precept.
More important still, he has also had an opportunity
of observing his pupil&rsquo;s bias; he notices
the strokes which come naturally to his hand,
the parries he most affects, the natural promptings
of his impulse, impetuous or cautious as the case
may be. He makes a study of his artless
scholar, who is clumsily feeling his feet, reads
him like a book, catches him in the act so to
speak, and detects the working of his character,
and thenceforward he knows the way in which
his studies may be most profitably directed to
give full play to his individual temperament.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The assault teaches the novice what no
amount of lunging at the master&rsquo;s pad can drill
into him. It enters him to the sudden emergencies,
which in one shape or another arise at
every moment, to the movement and exertion
and keen emulation of real fighting. The assault
is in fact a lesson subsidiary to the formal lesson,
and you may rest assured that the instruction it
conveys is equally salutary.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; smilingly remarked the Comte de R.,
&ldquo;you are for open war with the existing routine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And with the old traditions. Yes, I am
afraid I am. But what can I do? You admit
the force of my arguments?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that fencing taught on my plan loses
its terrors?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I quite admit that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And in fact it is not really formidable. My
system is able to satisfy the requirements of all,
and I do not overshoot the mark, by over-anxiety
to reach it.</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;It is most important to bear in mind that it
is not necessary or even desirable to attend all
the professor&rsquo;s lectures, to pass all the examinations
and finally to qualify as Bachelor of
Arms in order to become a fair ordinary fencer.
After all in every art one usually admits the
professor&rsquo;s right to dictate the elementary principles
of his subject, but after the elementary
stage is passed we are not, I believe, always
ready to accept the professor&rsquo;s estimate of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
importance of the art which he happens to
teach. The remark applies equally to music,
to painting, to literature, and why not to
fencing? Poets we know are nothing if not
first-rate, but why should fencers be singled
out for this invidious distinction?</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may judge how firmly my own belief
is rooted, when I say that I am as strongly
convinced of the good results that follow from
&lsquo;premature assaults,&rsquo; as I am of the necessity of
making the lesson as simple and as clear as
possible.</p>

<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;I remember a story told by my friend,
M. Desbarolles, an artist who is endowed more
liberally than most of my acquaintance with
the warm artistic temperament. It is to be
found in one of his neatly written essays. He
had, it seems, studied fencing for two years
under a French master, in Germany I think,
when he paid a visit to M. Charlemagne, one
of the most famous instructors of the day, to
whom he had an introduction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;He fenced before the professor, and when
the bout was over expected to be complimented,
under the impression that he had done rather
well.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Will you allow me, Sir, to give you a word
of advice?&rsquo; asked the great man.</p>

<p>&lsquo;By all means,&rsquo; replied my friend.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then, let me recommend you to give up
loose play altogether for at least a year, and
confine your attention entirely to the lesson.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good heavens, what amazing perversity,
what pompous humbug! M. Desbarolles remarks
that he was utterly taken aback, and I can well
believe him, but he goes on to say that he
accepted the master&rsquo;s verdict, and never had
reason to repent it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he had not given his word for the fact,
I should certainly have ventured to hope, most
sincerely, that his sense of humour was sufficient
to save him from following such a piece of advice
to the letter, and in any case I am sure that it
was quite unnecessary for him to do so, in order
to become the charming fencer that he is and
one for whom I have the warmest admiration.</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;Do not tell me that the quickness of hand
and rapidity of movement, the alertness of body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
and mind required in loose play, can be imparted
by the lessons of a skilful instructor, if only he
is careful to graduate his instruction in proportion
to his pupil&rsquo;s progress. The result is mere
clock-work with the professor for mainspring,
counterfeit vitality set in motion by the word of
command; a most mechanical use of the intelligence.
The pupil cannot go wrong because he is
tied to his master&rsquo;s apron-strings. The master&rsquo;s
sword shows him exactly where to go with the
precision of a finger-post. He is like a man
swimming in a cork jacket, practising the motions
of swimming at his leisure, and not caring in the
least whether these motions would really support
him on the surface or let him sink to the bottom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That the formal lesson is useful I do not
doubt, that it has a monopoly of usefulness I
emphatically deny. Why allow it to meddle
with and domineer over things which do not
concern it? Let it keep its place and refrain
from trespassing outside its own dominions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The lesson can explain the logic and theory
of fencing, it can assign reasons and exhibit the
mechanical process, but it cannot deal with the
great Unknown, the tricksy spirit, which suddenly
starts out on the fencer under every shape and
form, always assuming some new disguise and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
upsetting in a moment the most perfect theories
and the most scientific combinations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The young fencer who undertakes his first
assault is like the heroic youth of the fairy tales,
who leaves his humble cottage and goes out into
the wide world to seek his fortune. Like him
he will meet with many strange adventures,
which will try his mettle, put his character to
the touch, and call into play all the resources of
his intelligence.</p>

<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you think that by continually
presenting this question to you in a new light
I am detaining you too long on one part of my
subject. My intention is to bring home to your
minds the conviction I so strongly feel myself.
If you only knew how many striking examples
I have witnessed of the truth of my assertion!</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may see one of these pupils taking his
lesson. He is a magnificent spectacle; his hand
perfectly correct, a grand lunge, his action
smooth and free; he follows his master&rsquo;s blade
through a cunning series of feints and false
attacks, ripostes and counter-ripostes, his parry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
is never beaten; not a fault, not a single
mistake; he is an animated illustration of his
master&rsquo;s treatise, which the author with pardonable
pride displays before you.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now in the assault pupils of this type are
far from maintaining their superiority. Their
mechanical agility is paralysed, when it is no
longer set in motion by the accustomed spring.
They know too little and at the same time they
know too much. They find out that the assault
is not the same thing as the lesson. Their
opponent&rsquo;s blade does not accommodate itself
to theirs with the precision to which they are
accustomed; the touch of the steel no longer
conveys those delicate hints, to which they
formerly responded with such alacrity, and of
course they lose their bearings. They have not
acquired the sort of defence which is ready for
anything, alike for well directed thrusts and
for more eccentric methods of attack, and they
look in vain for a succession of passes strictly
correlated in a systematic order.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Instead of marching with a swing along the
broad highway to which they are accustomed,
they find themselves lost in a wild and difficult
country without a guide and without confidence.
Habit will perhaps enable them to maintain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
some smartness of appearance, but they make
few hits, and in spite of their science and the
skill, which they undoubtedly possess up to a
certain point, they are continually beaten by
fencers, who are less scholarly perhaps, but who
have been better entered than they to the actual
combat, the manifold emergencies of practical
fighting, and who have learnt that strange
language, by which the sword contrives to
reveal the most delicate shades of meaning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have seen this happen so often, that I
have taken some trouble to study the question,
and I am convinced that if these same pupils
had been at less pains to make themselves
pedantically perfect in the peaceful and philosophic
practice of the lesson, and had been
made familiar at an early stage with the
changing incidents of the assault, they would
have been equally well disciplined, and at the
same time really dangerous fencers. Of course
I freely admit that exceptions may sometimes
be found, but they are the exceptions which
prove the rule.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<h3>VIII.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;We have now reached a point from which
we may survey the thrilling spectacle of the
assault, as fencers call the mimic combat, in
which desperate and brutal fighting is controlled
by skill, the hazardous duel, full of fire and fury,
between two combatants, who summon to their
aid all that they know or all that they think
they know.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can say with literal truth, that I have
never taken a foil in my hand for a serious
assault without feeling a real tremor, and most
fencers have experienced and indeed are generally
conscious of the same sensation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have listened so kindly to my rough
attempt to put together an extemporary course
of instruction, that I can confidently claim your
attention now; for we are about to find in this
great arena the rival systems face to face. I
shall put before you and examine at no great
length the various situations which are likely
to occur.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our imaginary pupil has now become a
fencer. He will no longer lunge merely at the
master&rsquo;s pad, henceforward he will cover his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
manly face with a mask. Shall we follow him
in his career?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;We will&rdquo;; replied my host in tragic tones.
&ldquo;The standard of revolt is raised. Lead on,
and we will follow you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Tis well,&rdquo; I answered in the same spirit.
&ldquo;The tryst is here, at the same hour,&mdash;to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>The next day I continued my discourse
thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the assault with its incessant alarms and
perilous crises, in encountering the wiles and
avoiding the snares of the enemy, those who use
the sword find their &lsquo;crowded hour of glorious
life,&rsquo; the hour crowded with illusions and disenchantments,
the rubs of fortune, the ups and
downs of victory or defeat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What legions of cunning counsels and
crafty wiles, from the deep-laid stratagem down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
to the sudden surprise, one finds marshalled in
the text-books, and how unmanageable and
superfluous they generally are. All that the
Spartan mother said to her son when he was
setting out for the wars was:&mdash;&lsquo;Be bold, be
resolute, be cautious.&rsquo; Do not her words contain
the whole? For all fighting, whether at
long range or at close quarters, is very much
alike, from schoolboys&rsquo; games to the most elaborate
military operations; and all the advice
of the world may be summed up in the eternal
law of attack and defence, which is stated in
these four words:&mdash;cunning, caution, energy,
audacity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Deceive your enemy: seize the critical
moment to attack him, that is the secret of
fighting. Cultivate the mistrust which suspects
the hidden snare, the caution which frustrates
his plots, combined with the energy and audacity
which surmount difficulties; try to encourage
in your enemy a spirit of wanton confidence;
turn a strong position which you cannot carry
by a direct attack; threaten one point when
you mean to concentrate your whole strength
on another; draw your adversary by a show
of weakness to attack you in your strongest
position; keep your plans secret; mask your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
approaches; and then by the sudden impetuosity
of your attack take him unawares, and if you
cannot secure a victory, contrive a safe retreat.
Such from the earliest times have been the
methods of the greatest commanders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The tactics of the field of battle and the
tactics of hand-to-hand fighting are identical,
for the simple reason that skill, or strategy, or
science, call it what you will, are but different
names to express the same idea. These are the
sage counsels; the rest belongs to inspiration,
the inward monitor which in moments of danger
warns us with tenfold insistence, and guides us
right.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too much stress is laid on education, too
little on individual intelligence. The lessons
are supposed to have trained and directed this
intelligence. But if your pupil is so wanting in
intelligence that he cannot enter into the spirit
of the game, if he can never rise to the occasion,
and never strike out a line of his own, what can
you expect? You may advise for ever, but his
mind will not respond, he will only listen and
forget.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is here that the two schools begin to part
company. I have already given you a general
view of the points in which they differ, and we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
need not now recur to the consideration of
general principles, with which you are already
acquainted.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;If we could return to the past, and witness
an exhibition of sword-play as it was understood
by the professors of only fifty years ago, what a
contrast we should find with the style of our
own day, even with our most severely classical
style. Our methods would certainly be called
revolutionary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was usual not so very long since to display
upon the bosom a fair red heart, stitched to the
fencing jacket, to show plainly for all eyes to see
the spot where hits should be placed. Attacks,
parries and ripostes were restricted by convention
to a very narrow circle. Any hit that went
wide of the mark was accounted execrable and
received with the most profound contempt.
Modern fencing is inclined to be somewhat less
fastidious. Hits in the low line are generally
acknowledged. But a hit below the belt! &lsquo;You
really do not expect me to follow your point
down there!&rsquo; is still the attitude of most fencers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
&lsquo;Call it a hit if you like, but really it is not
fencing. A school of arms, you know, is not a
school of surgery, you might leave those base
regions to the medical students.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;You smile, but I assure you that they mean
it seriously, without the least sarcasm. It is
quite true that any wound in that despised
region would be mortal almost to a certainty.
That is a detail; and they forget that a sword,
though it may be a civil and gentlemanly implement,
is still a lethal weapon. It really is very
strange to admit that it is wrong to disregard
the deadly character of the point when aimed in
one direction, but to claim that it is right to
disregard it when aimed in another. Yet most
men cling to this error with the utmost pertinacity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That you should despise a hit in the leg or
fore-arm I can well understand. By all means
concentrate your whole attention on the protection
of the parts of the body which contain
the vital organs. But not to use your utmost
care, your surest parries, your most anxious
precautions to defend the trunk,&mdash;high lines and
low,&mdash;always has been and is still a delusion, a
delusion which those who attempt to draw an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
impossible distinction between the assaults of
foil-play and real fighting with sharp swords,
vainly ask us to accept as an unassailable article
of faith.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a real distinction, for after all foil-play
can only be an imperfect representation of
real fighting. Our object should be to make
the resemblance as perfect as possible, and so
minimise the chances on which the ignorant
and brutal too confidently rely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let them see that you both know the
correct answer to a correct combination, and
that you are equally prepared to deal with the
wild and disorderly antics of an untutored
point.</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;You may often hear men say:&mdash;&lsquo;I do that
in the fencing room, I should be very sorry to
attempt it in a serious fight.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why attempt it at all? If your
judgment tells you that the stroke is good, it
is good for all occasions. If it is bad it cannot
be justified in any case.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Always bear in mind that you must pay
attention to all thrusts which might prove fatal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
in a serious encounter, and then if some day
you have the misfortune to find a real sword in
your hand, you will have the satisfaction of
knowing that you are fore-armed by habit
against known and familiar dangers. I cannot
emphasise this point too strongly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In short, the refusal to acknowledge hits
however low is a dangerous and a gratuitous
mistake. Why should a thrust aimed in that
direction not be of its kind as brilliant and
meritorious as another? Why should it be boycotted?
Is there any reason for this mysterious
taboo?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;The old master who used to teach us
fencing at school,&rdquo; remarked my host, &ldquo;would
fall foul of you with a vengeance, if he heard
you talk like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;I do not mean for a moment,&rdquo; I replied,
&ldquo;that I have any preference for hits in the low
line, but rather that I am more afraid of them,
because I have fenced too often with fencers
good and bad not to know how necessary it is
to be on one&rsquo;s guard against the dangers of wild
play.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For instance, those who make a practice of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
straightening their arm as they retire nearly
always drop their hand, and the point of their
weapon, whether they wish it or no, is necessarily
directed towards the low line. It is equally inevitable
that the same part should be threatened
by those who rightly or wrongly reverse the
lunge by throwing the left foot back on your
attack, at the same time stooping forwards, so
as to let your point pass over their head; and
ignorant fencers nearly always hit you there,
quite innocently and unintentionally.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should therefore guard that part of
the body as strictly as you guard the chest, and,
by a parity of reasoning, when you meet an
adversary who neglects to protect the low line
annoy him in that region frequently.</p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;It often happens that things that are most
neglected in one age become the ruling fashions
of the next, just as things once highly honoured
may often fall into complete discredit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take this instance. In an old and dusty
folio, entitled &lsquo;<i>Académie de l&rsquo;Espée</i><a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>,&rsquo; which I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
discovered yesterday banished to the darkest
corner of the library, I found several pages
entirely devoted to the art &lsquo;<i>of delivering a stroke
with the point at the right eye</i>.&rsquo; The point is
specified because in those days cuts and thrusts
were held in equal favour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you say to a thrust in the eye?
And yet if you will consult my folio you will
find a collection of plates illustrating all the
passes by which this brilliant stroke may be
brought off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know what is thought now-a-days of
a hit in the face, that is to say on the mask; we
are taught,&mdash;again quite wrongly,&mdash;not to take
the smallest notice of it. And this leads me to
hope that some day we may yet see a revolution,
by which the vulgar belly will claim its rights
and in its turn drive out the lordly bosom. It
will be rated too highly then, as it is too much
degraded now. But when did revolutions ever
know where to stop?</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the assault the one thing needful is
self-reliance. Trust to your own resources, and
do not imagine that you have to repeat word
for word the lesson that you have got by heart
from your book, but rather look for inspiration
to the resources of your native wit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;If any one came to me for advice, the
course I should recommend, not as a hard and
fast rule, but in a general way, would be something
of this sort:&mdash;Act as much as possible
on the defensive, keep out of distance, in order
to prevent your opponent from attacking you
without shifting his position, and in order to
compel him to advance on your point, the most
dangerous thing he can do, and without a doubt
the most difficult art to acquire. If you make
up your mind to stand your ground whatever
happens, and to attack always in exact measure,
instead of retiring and advancing with quick
and irregular movements, and instead of trying
to surprise and overwhelm your adversary with
combinations for which he is unprepared, you
are to my mind simply acting without the least
judgment, or rather you are making a perverse
blunder.</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;Then I should go on to say, always supposing
that I was asked for my opinion:&mdash;Make
a practice of stepping back as you form the
parry, if only half a pace. There is everything
to be gained by it, and there is no objection to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
it that I can see, unless it be the strong objection
that your opponent will feel to being considerably
embarrassed on every possible occasion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The advantages, on the other hand, are
manifold. By stepping back you increase the
effectiveness of the parry, because by withdrawing
the body you, in a sense, double the rapidity
of the hand. If the attack has been delivered
with sufficient rapidity to beat the parry, by
retiring you parry twice, the first time with your
blade, with which you try to find your adversary&rsquo;s
weapon, the second time by removing the
body to a greater distance, with the result that
the point, which would have hit you if you had
stood your ground, does not reach your chest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By employing this man&oelig;uvre against simple
attacks you counteract rapidity of execution,
and by employing it against composite attacks
or against feints you encounter the last movement
forcibly. It is also of service in screening
one from attacks made by drawing back the
arm, for it often happens if you stand your
ground, that your hand starts too soon, and your
sword encounters nothing but empty air. It has
the further advantage of increasing the fencer&rsquo;s
confidence in himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not imagine that it hinders the riposte.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
It renders it easier and more certain. Nearly
always, when a fencer has lunged right out, and&mdash;as
often happens&mdash;does not recover immediately,
the two opponents are so close together
that it is very difficult to get in the riposte
without shortening the arm, and so giving an
opportunity for a <i>remise</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The parry and riposte without breaking
ground are certainly of value, I do not dispute
that, but against the fencers of all sorts, whom
you have to meet, and who offer all sorts and
kinds of difficulty, they should not be employed
except occasionally, and only when they are
almost certain to succeed. To my mind it
would be dangerous and unreasonable to adopt
them as the systematic basis of your play.</p>

<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;My reason for insisting so strongly on this
point is that I have nearly always found that it
is thought to be very magnificent to stand up to
the parry, whereas breaking ground is regarded
as the shift of a man hard pressed, a last resort
when the hand has proved too slow, or when it
is necessary to retrieve an error of judgment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now my plan provides you with a second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
line of defence, without infringing any of the
recognised canons; it is consistent with the
most classical style, and with perfect control
of your weapon. And one may well ask why,
when two chances of safety are at your disposal,
you should deliberately resolve to avail yourself
of only one of them?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should accordingly reverse the usual
advice, thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;As a general rule and on principle break
ground as you parry, either by a few inches or
by a clear pace, according to the momentum of
your opponent&rsquo;s attack, for by breaking ground
I do not mean to say that you are to avoid a
hit by continual and precipitate bolting.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Sometimes stand firm, but only when you
are sure that you have at last induced your
opponent to develope an attack, which you have
long been waiting for him to make.&rsquo;</p>

<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Unless I know my man, or have come to
an understanding with him beforehand, I have
very little faith in a prolonged concatenation of
parries, ripostes and counter-ripostes, and here
again I should try to relieve the mind, as much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
as may be, from an unnecessary burden, by
getting rid of complications instead of multiplying
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I look at it in this way. If a fencer has to
concern himself with the different lines in which
he may be attacked, he must be in a state of
continual suspense. He will be continually
asking himself whether the attack is coming
in the inside line or the outside, in the high line
or the low. Thus, in order to parry to advantage
and correctly he must wait until his
enemy&rsquo;s object is clearly disclosed. Take the
case of a simple attack promptly executed; it
is obvious that the attacker must gain a considerable
start. True, there are a few fencers,
but very few, gifted with so fine a sense of
touch, that they can divine their adversary&rsquo;s
intention, and read his inmost thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Less gifted mortals should be content with
a parry which mechanically traverses all the
lines. Such a parry must of necessity encounter
the adverse blade forcibly in whichever line the
enemy has selected for his attack. When once
you have acquired this universal parry the strain
is lessened, your mind is more at ease, you are
more sure of yourself and feel that you can act
with certainty and decision.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<h3>VIII.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;There are two kinds of parry, among those
which I enumerated the other day, which answer
this purpose equally well. The first consists in
combining the parry of <i>tierce</i> or <i>counter tierce</i>
with a <i>cut over</i> and beat in <i>quarte</i>; the second
in parrying <i>counter tierce</i> and <i>counter quarte</i> in
succession, and vice versa, or <i>counter quarte</i> and
<i>circle</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These covering parries though they are
technically composite, in practice are fairly
simple, and rapidly pass through all the lines
that are open to attack. Choose the one which
you prefer instinctively, which is another way
of saying the one that comes most naturally to
your hand. Or, if you like, use sometimes one,
sometimes the other.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;But what if this parry is deceived?&rdquo; asked
the Comte de R.</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;&lsquo;Deception no cheating&rsquo;
is the fencer&rsquo;s motto. There is no such thing as
an attack that cannot be parried, or a parry that
cannot be deceived. Sooner or later the fatal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
moment comes, and superior activity or superior
cunning prevails.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If any professor can invent an attack which
it is impossible to resist, or a parry which it is
impossible to deceive, I should advise him to
take very good care to secure the patent rights
of his invention without a moment&rsquo;s delay. He
would certainly have no difficulty in floating a
company to put it on the market in all the
capitals of Europe.</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;I have already expressed my opinion that
a fencer&rsquo;s strength lies much more in presence
of mind and in quickness of hand than in a very
varied play. This is so true that the majority
of fencers, amateur and professional alike, affect
certain favourite strokes; they have favourite
attacks, favourite parries and ripostes, and always
come back to them as to old friends on
whose services they can confidently rely. In
the course of an assault the same stroke is often
repeated in many different ways; the shape it
takes changes with the changing incidents of
the fight, and accordingly as it is adapted to
suit the peculiarities of the individual against
whom it is employed. That is the great beauty
of a stroke in fencing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Some of you, I know, are not fencers, but
there are one or two connoisseurs present, who
have studied the art, and are experts. It is to
them that I now appeal. As an illustration of
my argument I will take the most simple parry,
the parry of quarte, and I will ask them if it is
not the fact that it constantly changes and
undergoes surprising transformations? Sometimes
it is a light touch, sometimes a vigorous,
almost a violent blow; it may form a high
parry, it may form a low parry, it serves for
every purpose and answers every call that can
be made upon it. Watch the blade as the parry
is formed;&mdash;perhaps it just meets the adverse
blade and suddenly quits it or it may hold and
dominate it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is this power of varying the stroke and
transforming it at will that marks the true
fencer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The man, I repeat, who is content to recite
his lesson by rote, however well he has learnt it,
can never be anything more than a school-boy;
call him that or an accomplished parrot, whichever
he prefers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<h3>IX.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;I was reading one of the ancient treatises,
which are reposing peacefully on your dusty
shelves, my dear C., when I came across the
following passage, which rather struck my
fancy:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The law of defence declares that your motions
should be the natural motions of a man&rsquo;s body.
But, however sacred the dignity of law may be,
nevertheless you ought to consider that necessity
knows no law, and that it overrides even the
weightiest laws of human contrivance.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;That was written in 1600. The maxim is
a trifle too sweeping for general application, but
it seems to me to be a good and serviceable
maxim when applied to sword-play.</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;My remarks are perhaps somewhat disconnected.
I am simply giving you my ideas at
random, as they occur to me. But my main
object is to direct your attention to the points
which appear to me of some importance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After the parries come the ripostes. On
this subject a few words will suffice. Never
forget that the parry and riposte are twin sisters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
whose lives are so closely bound up in each
other, that they cannot exist apart. Riposte
and parry ought to be so closely allied that
the riposte may seem to be the second part
of the parry. Therefore, as a general principle,
riposte direct, in the line in which you have
found the blade. Changing the line wastes
time, and gives your adversary an opportunity
to pull himself together and make a <i>remise</i> or
renew the attack. Never, on any consideration,
allow yourself to draw back your arm, for then
your riposte is lost,&mdash;as well throw your purse in
the gutter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If your judgment tells you that your
adversary is waiting for your direct riposte,
and has attacked you with the object of
drawing it, or if you have noticed that he
covers himself effectively on that side, while
he leaves you a clear opening elsewhere, then
avoid the trap by a disengagement or a
cut-over; but only make one feint, never more
than one. For, if you do, though you may
succeed once, you will probably find out later
that your success was dearly bought. It is
always wise, you know, to count the cost, and
economise your resources, unless you wish to
take the straight road to ruin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<h3>X.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Our chat to-night,&rdquo; I remarked after a
moment&rsquo;s silence, &ldquo;if it has not been very long,
has at least been very serious. I only complain
that you have not sufficiently interrupted me.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;We have been listening to you,&rdquo; said the
Comte de R., &ldquo;very attentively, because you
warned us of the importance of your subject.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;Very well, my dear R.,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;Now
just imagine you are in court, and let us hear
how you would sum up the case for the benefit
of the jury.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;I fancy I can do that rather well,&rdquo; answered
R. &ldquo;Let me try:&mdash;The lesson, you say, is the
school-room, the assault is the fencer&rsquo;s career, a
free field for enterprise, where he must stand or
fall by dint of his own unaided genius. The
only counsels, which are worth anything, are
those which have governed attack and defence
from time immemorial. For attack, the union
of desperate energy with cool and calculating
caution; for defence, firmness, wariness, self-reliance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, passing from the general question to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
points of detail, or execution, I should add:&mdash;It
is a great mistake, a piece of inconceivable
folly, to have boycotted, to use your own
expression, hits in the very low lines, because
the fencer is prevented thereby from acquiring
the habit of strictly guarding those parts of the
body, where in a serious encounter any wound
would probably prove fatal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As a general rule step back as you form the
parry, to make assurance doubly sure, and to
give greater freedom to your riposte. Stand
your ground only when you think you have
judged the stroke to a nicety, and when you
hold your adversary in a tight place, from which
he cannot escape.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;I am infinitely obliged to you, my dear R.,&rdquo;
I remarked. &ldquo;You have summarised most excellently
the points that I have worked out in
detail, and you have exactly caught my
meaning.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;Very good of you to say so,&rdquo; answered R.,
&ldquo;but let me finish:&mdash;In order to keep your
wits about you, and to avoid trying to think
of too many things at once, adopt as a rule a
universal parry, which will cut all the lines, and
must meet and drive away your opponent&rsquo;s blade.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
Always riposte direct, and be careful on your
riposte to avoid making feints which expose you
to a <i>remise</i> or to a renewal of the attack. Does
that satisfy you?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;You have taken us over the ground most
admirably, my dear Professor. To-morrow, I
propose to discuss the attack, and in this connection
we shall have to consider what is usually
called &lsquo;<i>le sentiment du fer</i>,&rsquo; the fencer&rsquo;s sense of
touch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To this sovereign principle we are asked to
swear allegiance, as though it occupied the throne
by divine right. I shall ask you to consider the
pretensions of another claimant of very noble
lineage to a share of the royal honours.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>Although our conversation was quite
informal and simply an after-dinner
amusement, I found that it involved diligent
preparation, especially when I was approaching
one of the questions where I was in open conflict
with current theories, which are often taken
for granted on no better ground than their
respectable antiquity.</p>

<p>One of these theories, which is described in
fencing language as the importance of judging
the blade by touch, I was now prepared to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
challenge, and I was ready to maintain the
superiority of another principle, against which
the professors raise their voices, almost with
one accord, in a chorus of unmerited abuse.
Accordingly when we assembled in the smoking-room,
I took my usual seat and began without
preface.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I had better explain what is meant
by refusing to join blades. It means that, as
soon as you have come on guard, you break
away from the engagement, and avoid crossing
swords with your adversary, instead of allowing
the blades to remain in contact.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This, I consider, was one of the most
successful innovations of what it is the fashion
to call &lsquo;The New School&rsquo;; and I am therefore
very far from sharing the opinions of the
professors, who discover in the practice the
corruption of the best traditions of sword-play,
and declare that the refusal to join blades is
equivalent to fencing blindfold, and without
judgment; it leads, they say, to mutual hits,
and deprives the fencer of one of the finest
accomplishments he can acquire, the power of
judging the sword by touch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Undoubtedly the fencer&rsquo;s touch is a great
resource; I am even willing to allow that it is
invaluable, and it is a thing that can only be
obtained by practice and perseverance; it gives
lightness and dexterity to the hand, and enables
the foil to be manipulated with accuracy and
speed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the refined result that is derived from
extreme ease in regulating the extension of the
arm, from exquisite subtlety in the use of the
fingers, and from precision of play, which involves
its victim almost unawares, dismays, and utterly
confounds him. I profess the greatest admiration
for this consummate power of fence, so
seldom seen to perfection. No one can think
more highly of it than I do, and on that account
I am strongly convinced of the necessity of
devising a means to resist it, when it is used
against me. I shall perhaps be told to combat
it by an equally fine sense of touch;&mdash;but it is
still more rare to see a bout of fencing in which
the two men are evenly matched in this respect,
and general principles should be based on
general grounds, not on exceptional cases.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The man who possesses this consummate
sleight of touch may almost be said to control
his opponent&rsquo;s blade by the exercise of his will.
By a sort of hypnotic influence or fascination he
does with it what he pleases. If you refuse the
engagement, you create a difficulty for him; if
you do not allow him to bring his blade into
contact with yours, you put an impediment in
his way, which his skill will doubtless overcome,
but with less certainty; his course is not so
clear, and he is no longer completely master of
the situation. For if you join blades you are
always within striking distance of his point, that
is to say he can attack you at any moment
without shifting his ground. Now such attacks
are exceedingly difficult to stop, even for the
most practised hand, especially simple attacks
such as straight thrusts or simple disengagements.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The mind perpetually held in suspense is
harassed and distressed, you have no leisure to
think for yourself and are demoralised by the
slow torture of a constant strain. For, I repeat,
it is very rare to find two fencers so evenly
matched in this respect that the risk is equally
divided.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In that case I should say:&mdash;&lsquo;Do what you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
please.&rsquo; In the other case:&mdash;&lsquo;By refusing the
engagement you can at first keep your opponent
out of distance, which will compel him to advance
in order to attack you, and so give you fair
warning of his intention. You are no longer
exposed to the paralysing influence of a constantly
threatened attack, which destroys your
liberty of action and judgment; you disconcert
your adversary by leaving him in the dark as
to the line in which he will encounter your
blade; and you can choose your own time,
when you are ready to attack or parry, to
engage his blade with decision.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For my own part, I am quite satisfied that
the system is a safe and sound defensive measure,
which offers advantages that cannot be denied.
Pressures, binds, beats and <i>croisés</i>, all those
dangerous movements by which your opponent
can bring the <i>fort</i> of his blade to bear on the
<i>faible</i> of yours, are rendered very difficult to
perform, and are much less likely to succeed.
Surprise attacks are entirely or at least so
nearly eliminated, that their occurrence is a
rare event.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;I have endeavoured to state as clearly as
possible the advantages that a weak fencer may
derive from this system, when he is opposed to
a combatant more experienced and more skilful
than himself; but further than that, I believe
that the skilful and experienced fencer has
also something to gain by adopting this much
despised method. I have myself never been
able to discover that it is incompatible with
perfect &lsquo;form,&rsquo; or that it tends to wild play.
It opens a wider field, it shows the fallacy of
certain ideas, which have been wrongly supposed
to be unassailable, and it furnishes a whole range
of new situations, another world to conquer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What ground is there, I would ask my
critic, for your assertion that I must be fencing
blindly, because my sword does not happen to
be in constant touch with yours? Why do you
say that mutual hits must occur more frequently?
If you are talking of a pair of duffers, who
charge each other blindly, you may trust them
to commit every possible blunder, whether they
join blades or not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why should you exalt so highly what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
you call the faculty of touch, the power of
judging the blade by touch, and be so ready
to degrade that other sovereign principle, which
may be called the faculty of sight, the power of
judging the sword by eye? Can you deny the
controlling influence of the eye, the authority
that belongs to it? Do you believe that the
eye cannot be trained to the same degree of
nicety as the hand? Why, when you have
these two forces at your disposal, are you
content to let one of them do duty for both?</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may keep your opponent at his
distance by the menace of your nimble point,
which flashes in his sight incessantly; while
your watchful eye follows the movements of
his sword and reads his thought, as well as if
the blades were crossed and questioned each
other by the language of the steel. Then, when
it suits your convenience, when you see a favourable
opportunity, when you have by a rapid
calculation reckoned up the situation, weighed
the chances, taken everything into account, then
is the time to offer your sword, then is the time
to engage your adversary, or by bold decided
movements to get control of his blade.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; objected one of my hearers, &ldquo;what
if your adversary adopts the same tactics, and
refuses the engagement?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;That is where science and strength, skill
and personal superiority tell. What is fencing
if it is not the art of leading your opponent into
a trap, the art of making him think that he
will be attacked in one place, when you mean
to hit him in another? the skill to outwit his
calculations, to master his game, paralyse his
action, outman&oelig;uvre him, reduce him to impotence?&mdash;That
is the sort of thing the accomplished
fencer sets himself to do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your adversary, you say, will not come to
an engagement. Very good; then you must
force him to it by feints, or by threatening to
attack. Either he attempts to parry or he
attempts to thrust. In either case you get
command of his blade by a simple or by a
double beat, as the case may be, and then you
drive your attack home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It holds good with fencing, as it does with
all warlike measures, whether on a large scale or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
small, that you must not wait for what you want
to be brought to you; you must learn to help
yourself; take no denial, but by force or fraud
get possession.</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;Now, I appeal to you all as critics, not on a
technical question of fencing, on which no one
can be expected to give an opinion without a
thorough knowledge of the art, but on a simpler
matter. I will contrast two assaults. Imagine
that you are the spectators. The first is between
two fencers of the classical school, to use the
conventional phrase.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The swords are crossed, and the two adversaries,
both gifted with consummate skill, stand
facing each other, foot to foot. Feint follows
feint, and parry parry; a simple attack is
delivered, it is succeeded by a combination.
The attitudes of both are irreproachable; the
body always upright; the quick hand with
exquisite finesse manipulates the dancing point
by subtle and accurate finger-play. You admire
the exhibition; for a moment you follow the
quick passage of the blades, but your sympathies
are not aroused, you are not carried away, or
enthralled in spite of yourself in a fever of
anxious expectation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Now turn to the other assault. This also
is fought by two skilful fencers, but they go to
work on quite a different system.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look at the combatants. Instead of standing
foot to foot, and blade to blade, they are out
of distance, on the alert, ready to strike but
cautious. Their eyes follow each other, and
watch for the tell-tale movement. Suddenly
they close, the blades cross, interlock, and break
away. That was a searching thrust! But by
a sudden retreat, a rapid movement, perhaps a
leap backwards, the fencer evades the hit, and is
ready on the instant to give back the point.
This assault is a battle between two men, who
mean hard fighting, keen swordsmen, dodgy,
artful, and slippery, who bring to bear all their
science, employ every trick they can think of,
and throw themselves body and soul into the
fight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now let me ask you, which of these two
assaults is the more interesting to follow?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;I remember an assault, in M. Pons&rsquo;s rooms,
between one of my friends and a man who was
generally considered and really was a strong
fencer, although he insisted on clinging to that
mischievous routine, which with some men is a
superstition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They came on guard, and my friend, after
crossing swords to show that he was ready to
defend himself, quitted the engagement, attacked,
and hit his opponent several times.</p>

<p>&lsquo;But, Sir,&rsquo; his opponent objected, &lsquo;you do
not join blades.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why should I?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Unless you join blades, how am I to fence?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That is your look-out.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But you must join blades.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why <i>must</i> I? My only object, I assure
you, is to endeavour, as well as I am able, to
disconcert my opponent, and as I find that
this plan disconcerts you considerably, I see all
the more reason why I should continue to
employ it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That may be,&rsquo; rejoined the other sticking to
his point, &lsquo;but if you do not join blades, it is not
fencing.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said my friend, &lsquo;let us try for a
moment to discuss the matter. Tell me, are
my hits improperly delivered?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, no.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Did I stab, or come in with a round-arm?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Certainly not&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Is there anything wrong with my parries?
Are they too wide, or what? Is my hand too
heavy, or do you complain of mutual hits?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, that is not the point.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then, what more do you want?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I want you to join blades.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;To oblige you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, I do not say that. But unless you join
blades it is not fencing.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And say what one might, nothing would
make him budge from his everlasting axiom.</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;It is always so, whenever an attempt is
made to interfere with the traditions of any art
whatever. The man who tries to strike out a
new line cannot fail to disturb the tranquil
repose of ancient custom. The conservatives
resist, they object to interference, they feel that
their placid triumphs, their cherished habits are
threatened. The regular routine, which has been
drilled into them, till they know it like an old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
tune of which every turn and every note is
familiar, will be unsettled. They have good
reason to be annoyed, but that does not prove
them to be right.</p>

<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;At the present day people have gradually
come to admit that there is some good in these
innovations, which have suddenly enlarged the
scope of fencing. &lsquo;Fencing,&rsquo; they say, &lsquo;is more
difficult than it used to be, but less graceful.&rsquo;
Are these qualities then necessarily incompatible
with each other?</p>

<p>&ldquo;In order to make a clear distinction between
those who run after strange gods, and the &lsquo;auld
lichts&rsquo; who have preserved intact the primitive
tradition of the true faith, a phrase has been
invented to describe the backsliders. They are
said to be &lsquo;difficult fencers.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now what are these words supposed to
mean? Do they imply that a graceful fencer
is not difficult? No doubt, classical grace and
a masterly style are very fine things, which I, for
one, can appreciate and admire. But if I am
asked to choose between the graceful and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
difficult fencer,&mdash;if it is not possible to be both
at once,&mdash;I much prefer the latter, for I suppose
that &lsquo;difficult&rsquo; can only mean difficult to hit,
difficult to defeat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there is no need to suppose that
difficulty is incompatible with grace, at least
with grace of a certain kind, the grace of manly
and robust energy, which sits well upon the
fighting man, such grace as in old times so well
became the gallant chevaliers, who illumined by
their prowess the spacious days of ruff and
rapier.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have here another of the important
points of difference between the two schools.
Some people treat the newcomer like an inconvenient
guest, whom they cannot very well
turn out of doors. But they may as well make
up their minds that the intruder can take care
of himself, and will find room for his ample
proportions in the domestic circle. He has
come to stay, and whether they like him or
not he means to make one of the party.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The axiom&mdash;&lsquo;Hit and do not be hit back&rsquo;
ought, in spite of everything that can be said
against it, to be the motto of all who fight with
the sword. Science may teach how to hit well,
but its first lesson should be, how not to be hit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
at all by the arrant duffer, who uses his sword
by the light of nature. When swordsmanship
fails to keep this end in view, we may be very
sure that it is off the track. &lsquo;Business first&rsquo;
must be the invariable rule.</p>

<h3>VIII.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;There was a time when the mask was not
worn for the assault. And I remember reading
some time ago in the <i>Encyclopaedia</i>, published
about the middle of last century (1755), under
the word <i>mask</i> the following remarks:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p2">&lsquo;In foil-play Fencers have sometimes carried
precaution so far as to wear a mask, to protect
themselves from possible hits in the face. It is
true that those who have acquired little skill in
the Art may chance to wound their Adversary
by a clumsy thrust, or cause themselves to be
wounded by throwing up the point with a bad
parry. It is however never worn at the present
day.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;This encyclopaedia evidently reflects the
ideas which were generally accepted at the time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
To wear a mask in a bout with the foils was as
much as to say that you considered your opponent
a duffer, and was not far short of an
insult.</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;Fencing in those days was nothing but a
formal series of attacks, feints, parries and
ripostes, well understood and defined by the
code; every movement led up to some other
movement, which was rigidly prescribed. If a
fencer had ventured on a straight thrust while
the feints were in progress, instead of elaborately
following the blade through every turn of the
labyrinth, he would have been considered an
unmannerly cub, and sent back to study his
rudiments. It was only in the last years of the
period signalised by the famous Saint-Georges
that the mask came into general use. Even
then the only masks used were made of tin, and
the professors&rsquo; view was that such safeguards
were permissible for rough players. But it so
happened that three professors each lost an eye.
And their respect for ancient tradition did not
go far enough to induce them to risk losing
the one that remained. After that the wire
mask was generally adopted, but not without
regret.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<h3>IX.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Every generation takes the march of progress
one stage further, or at least modifies
existing institutions in its own way. It is not
so long since the fanciful multiplication of feints,
of which I was speaking just now, was considered
the correct game; the right thing to do
was to follow the blade until you found it. At
the present day it is no longer part of the
necessary ritual to follow always every vagary.
Suppose you feint inordinately, I suddenly let
drive with opposition of the hand, or simply
straighten my arm and hit you with a stop
thrust, which interferes rather effectively with
your trickiness, and spoils the magnificent
flourishes of your arabesques. These hits are
now recognised and regularly taught. If need
be, instead of lunging you slip the left foot to
the rear, throw the left shoulder well back, so as
to be out of the way, and drop the body, in
order to avoid being hit yourself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The system of our fathers, which in many
respects was excellent but at the same time
was remarkable for several very odd and very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
peremptory theories, has in many instances been
successfully assailed. Perhaps in some cases its
assailants have themselves been too peremptory,
and this has led to that loss of temper and angry
recrimination, by which the debate has been
embittered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I must not tax your patience further
to-night. We had better adjourn the discussion
until to-morrow; otherwise you will be tired of
hearing me talk, and I am sincerely anxious to
command your whole attention.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Fencing,&rdquo; I began, when we had all
reassembled as usual, &ldquo;is such an inexhaustible
topic, that I could not, if I would,
pretend to go minutely into all its practical
details. No one gifted with a modicum of
sense, a little determination, and a dash of
enterprise, can fail to strike out a line for himself.
I am obliged, as you see, to content myself with
a general view. For we cannot consider the
assault, and especially an assault in which the
combatants use their heads as well as their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
hands, without assuming that our young friend
has gained some science, and has become an
educated fencer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have already spoken of parries and ripostes,
and you have seen that the lesson teaches
how these should be employed. You know
what use may be made of the sense of touch,
the power of feeling the blade, and of the
electric influence of the eye. It remains to say
a few words on the subject of attacks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is more dangerous to attack than to
parry. Instead of waiting you let yourself go.
And the great difficulty is to know how to
let yourself go far enough without going too
far.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remember that discretion is the better
part of valour; but do not confound discretion
with timidity. I have already said that you
ought to be able and willing, and more than
that, that you ought to make it your object to
encounter every sort of style, even those styles
which are hardly worthy or&mdash;to be quite candid&mdash;are
quite unworthy of the name. As a matter
of fact there are such styles, and therefore it is
just as well not to allow their exponents to
become conceited, or to imagine that by any
chance they can possibly be effective.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It is important for the prestige of fencing,
that those who have no knowledge of their
weapon, or at most a mere smattering, should
not be allowed to suppose that they can depend
upon mere energy and a blind rush to defend
themselves against a man who has been trained
to the skilful handling of the sword. Confidence,
that mainest mainstay of defence, ought not to
be possible for the ignorant fencer; it ought
to be the peculiar privilege of the trained and
scientific expert.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;To come back to the various situations
which may occur in the assault. If I see a
fencer, as soon as he falls on guard, engage
swords, and at once hurriedly let fly thrust after
thrust, attack following attack in quick succession,
if he neglects to test the length of his
opponent&rsquo;s sword by gradually feeling his way,
by employing all the necessary tactics of the
preliminary skirmish, by prospecting for information
and discreetly sounding the enemy, then
to my mind he may be classed at once. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
may have some dexterity, a certain power of
execution, but by the mere act of joining blades
he may be set down as a blind fencer, far more
truly than the man who keeps out of distance,
and chooses the proper moment at one time to
refuse, at another, when least expected, to take
the engagement, or to seize his opponent&rsquo;s
blade with courage and resolution.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; remarked the Comte de R.,
&ldquo;that, a few years hence, it is highly probable
that a new set of theories will be invented to
supersede these modern ideas, which are so
hotly disputed now, and they in their turn will
be considered out of date.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;No doubt that is to be expected in the
nature of things. The form may or rather
certainly will change, but the substance will be
unaltered. Let me submit evidence to prove it.
I mentioned the other day some old books on
sword-play which I hoped to look through. I
will only refer to them for one moment. I
managed to read them all, and dreary reading it
was, but I got through them, being supported
by a conscientious sense of duty, and I unearthed
among others the two following passages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The first on the subject of <i>Approaches</i> was
written in the seventeenth century, that is to
say, it is about two hundred years old:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p2">&lsquo;The reason why you must make your steps
of unequal Measure is that thereby you always
hold your Adversary in Suspense and uncertain
what you would be at. For if you always go
about your business of a set way and with a set
regularity of step, it may happen that the Enemy
will make his reckoning so exactly, that he can
direct his sword not only at the place where he
sees you to be, but even at that place to which
he knows you will presently come, whereof by
this means he is hindered.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;One might suppose that this was written
yesterday. Could any professor, however skilful,
put the point better or more logically? The
weapons however were very different from ours,
heavy cut and thrust rapiers, wielded sometimes
in one hand, sometimes in both; but the laws of
judgment, caution, and strategy were the same,
and will be the same a hundred years hence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To prove once more that this new school,
which a few years since was received with a
howl of abuse, really did not advance such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
very extravagant doctrines, and that the power
of eye, which we were discussing yesterday, is
intimately connected with the power of touch,
I have made a note of these other few lines,
still on the subject of attacks:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p2">&lsquo;It follows that the great gain that Science
gives is Security in making your Approaches,
which cannot be obtained except you thoroughly
comprehend the Importance both of Touch and
Eye; and you may rest assured that bodily
activity and readiness of hand are alike as
nothing when weighed against a good Approach.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;And we are reluctantly obliged to admit
that after all our original ideas have been anticipated,
and we stand convicted of plagiarism.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I might revenge myself for the trouble I
have taken to ransack these ancient folios, by
inflicting upon you any number of quotations,
but I will be merciful, and am content to have
demonstrated that the ideas that are supposed
to be most radical are often, when they come to
be examined, most truly conservative.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;I have another question for you,&rdquo; continued
the Comte de R. &ldquo;You were speaking the other
day of feints and stop thrusts. Of course it was
ridiculous to expect an opponent to follow every
gyration, which you chose to describe with the
point of your sword, but don&rsquo;t you think that
nowadays the practice of straightening the arm
on every possible occasion is utterly overdone?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;No doubt it is by some men&mdash;overdone, or
rather very badly done, which amounts to the
same thing. &lsquo;<i>Ne quid nimis</i>&rsquo; you know is a
good motto, and I quite agree with you, however
little you may like it, that this movement, which
comes more by instinct than by intention, is
now the refuge of those who cannot parry; but,
mind this, it is a refuge, from which it is often
very difficult to dislodge them. I quite admit
that those who straighten the arm without any
justification are hopelessly unscientific, but they
present a difficulty to surmount, which requires
serious attention.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me explain before going on. There is
a distinction to be made between stop thrusts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
and time thrusts. The stop thrust is taken,
when your opponent advances incautiously, or
when he draws back his arm while executing a
complicated attack, whenever in fact he makes
a movement which leaves him exposed. The
time thrust on the other hand, correctly speaking,
is a parry of opposition,&mdash;the most dangerous
of all parries, for if it fails it leaves you absolutely
exposed and at the mercy of your opponent. I
have seen it taught in the lesson by every master
(as an exercise no doubt), but I have hardly ever
seen a master put it into practice in the assault.
The thrust has nothing to recommend it, but on
the contrary it is to be condemned on many
grounds. I should like to see it ignominiously
expelled from the fencing room, as the buyers
and sellers were expelled from the temple.</p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Do you follow the distinction? A time
thrust is taken on the final movement of an
attack, when you think you know exactly what
is coming, and can judge with certainty in what
line the point will be delivered. Very well, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
parry instead of timing; for if you are wrong&mdash;and
who is not sometimes?&mdash;you can at any
rate have recourse to another parry. Whereas
the time thrust, when misjudged, results in a
mutual hit, and for one that is good tender how
much base metal you will put into circulation.
The stop thrust, which is taken, as I have said,
on the opponent&rsquo;s advance, is less dangerous.
Therefore never attack a man, who straightens
his arm on every occasion, without making sure
of his blade, and you need have no fear of the
result.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is quite true that the practice of straightening
the arm is much more prevalent than it
used to be; simply because this style of play,
which is of great antiquity, had gone out of
fashion, and given place to another method,
which in its turn was overdone,&mdash;the method
of feints and flourishes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So too, the trick of reversing the lunge by
throwing back the left foot and dropping the
body, to allow the attack to pass over your
head, is not an invention of the &lsquo;Romantic&rsquo;
school, as it has been ridiculously christened.
It is an old trick, a ruse of great antiquity,
which may or at all events ought to be found
in Homer. Still, unless your opponent drives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
you to it by wild and frantic rushes, it is a
stroke to be used sparingly, and with the object
of letting him know that you are ready to receive
him. By this means you will stop him
from rushing at you on every possible occasion.
I like to see a stop thrust correctly taken,
always provided that I do not see others in
the course of the same assault taken incorrectly,&mdash;for
then it is obvious that the correct thrust
was a simple fluke.</p>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;I am speaking now from the scientific
standpoint. Perhaps I can put my point more
clearly. If my opponent says:&mdash;&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t profess
to be scientific; I simply defend myself by the
light of nature,&rsquo; he may do what he likes, I shall
not complain of his mistakes; he is perfectly
within his rights and knows no better. But the
expert fencer has no business to make mistakes,
or at least he should try to avoid them as far as
he can.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even at the risk of being lynched for my
unorthodox opinions, I should venture to say to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
the would-be fencer:&mdash;&lsquo;Above all things make
yourself dangerous. Be &lsquo;a difficult fencer,&rsquo; since
that is the stereotyped phrase. Without it there
is no salvation; your guns are not shotted, your
performance is mere fire-works.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But be careful not to give these words a
wider application than they are meant to carry.
All that I would say is this:&mdash;that you are to
follow your natural instinct, to trust your impulse,
to be yourself and not your master&rsquo;s
puppet. I do not mean to propound an acrobatic
theory of fencing, or to recommend a
meaningless, objectless, indiscriminate charging
about, like the convulsive struggles of a wild
beast, that has received its death wound. It
would be as wrong to take such extravagant
exceptions for your model, as it would be unfair
to argue from them in order to demonstrate
the futility of the new school.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No doubt fencers of this kind,&mdash;they call
themselves fencers,&mdash;may score an occasional
hit, for, as I have had occasion to remark already,
there is always a certain amount of luck
in fencing; but this sort of thing is not fencing;
it is much more like mere brutal fisticuffs. Such
eccentric methods are of no importance, they
are not based on any sort of principle, but are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
the mere outcome of ignorance; they belong to
no school and have no permanent value. But
it does not do to despise an unbeaten enemy.
Therefore confront these methods and defeat
them first; you can afford to despise them
afterwards.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; exclaimed Monsieur de C., &ldquo;that
is exactly my opinion.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;One moment,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I have not quite
done. I was going to say, that I have very
little faith in the stories one hears of the regimental
fencing master being run through by the
recruit. Such an event may happen, just as a
chimney-pot may fall on your head when you
are walking in the street, but I fancy that if
you were to apply the rule of three to all the
cases the result would not exactly support the
paradox.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a class of fencers who are thoroughly&mdash;in
fact too thoroughly&mdash;convinced that
they are very dangerous fellows, and that they are
never hit. You repeatedly come across this sort
of thing in the fencing room:&mdash;Your opponent
delivers an attack which you parry; he stays
on the lunge doubled up, with his body dropped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
forward; your riposte lands perhaps in his mask,
perhaps in his back, or arm. Thereupon he
recovers and remarks with a negligent air: &lsquo;hit
in the mask,&rsquo; &lsquo;hit in the back,&rsquo; &lsquo;arm only,&rsquo; as
the case may be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, only in the mask! But, Sir, the point
would have run you through the head and traversed
your brain. In fact it would have been
quite as effective as a hit in the chest, which
penetrated your lungs. The other would have
gone six inches into your back; while the third
would have pierced your arm and run you
through the chest afterwards. You offer your
head, back, or arm instead of your chest, I hit
the part exposed and am quite satisfied. You
cannot evade or parry a thrust by substituting
for the part that would otherwise be hit some
other part, which you do not attempt to cover;
all that you do is to offer an exchange.</p>

<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose that these fencers would
pursue the same tactics, if they had to face a
naked point instead of the button of a foil, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
that they would fancy themselves out of danger,
if they laid themselves open to be run through
the head or back or neck? Such wounds are
not trivial and cannot be ignored. A sharp
point is a peremptory fact, which makes short
work of illusions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or again, do you imagine that anyone
would be very anxious in a real fight to run
the risk of double hits, by which he might
succeed in inflicting a serious wound, but only
at the expense of being run through the body
himself? No one would resort to such desperate
measures as these, unless there was absolutely
nothing else left to be done.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is so thoroughly true, that if you set
two men to fight in a fencing-room with blunt
swords, you notice at once that the assault is
something very different from what it would
have been with mere foils. You might almost
fancy that the swords, though they can no
longer wound, are still possessed by the spirit
of mortal combat, and retain some reminiscence
of the real thing, of naked chest opposed to
naked steel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is none of that brilliant dash, none
of those brilliant strokes that are usually more
conspicuous for temerity than judgment. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
fight is a sham fight still, but the players cannot
help taking it seriously. Each is saying to
himself:&mdash;&lsquo;Now let me see what would happen,
if we were in earnest.&rsquo; The different shape of
the hilt, the harsh grating of the steel affect
the imagination. &lsquo;Watch that fellow, see what
he is up to, make him keep his distance, give
him something to think about.&rsquo; That is the
sort of caution that the swords are whispering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may easily satisfy yourselves of the
truth of my remarks the next time you have an
opportunity of watching a bout of this sort.
And if there is so great a difference between
simple foils and blunt swords, you will have
no difficulty in believing that the difference
between blunt swords and sharp is far greater.
Wild play subsides, and those who were willing
to charge blindly, when they risked nothing
more than a dent in a leather jacket, prefer to
study ways and means a little more closely.
It is a very natural prompting of the instinct.
The rule is almost universal, but there are
occasional exceptions, which you may be called
upon to face, and if you do not want to be
taken by surprise, you had better make yourself
acquainted with them beforehand for what they
are worth.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;Then you approve,&rdquo; said M. de C., &ldquo;of
occasional practice with muffled swords?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;Not only of occasional but of constant
practice, and that not in the assault only, but
in the lesson too. The greater weight of the
sword and the wider blade, which is straight
and less whippy than the foil, steady the hand,
keep it in position, and give a truer aim.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;I notice,&rdquo; observed one of my friends,
&ldquo;that you have said nothing about left-handed
fencers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;The fact is, there is
hardly anything to say, and even the text-books,
which do not usually err on the side of brevity,
devote very little space to them. For there is
really no particular rule, which applies to them
exclusively.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But surely they are very difficult?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes in a way no doubt they are, though
one of my friends, a left-hander of course, used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
to say that the supposed difficulty is only a
convenient excuse invented by right-handed
fencers. His suggestion is more witty than
true, and I am willing to allow, without hesitation,
that left-handers really are puzzling to
those who are not accustomed to fence with
them. Their only real advantage is that they
have more opportunities of fencing against right-handers,
than right-handers have of fencing
against them. When once you are used to
them the difficulty vanishes. The left-hander
on the contrary, when it comes to fighting, is
never rid of the far graver risk which he takes
by exposing his left side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I may add that the left-hander&rsquo;s advantage,
which consists entirely in his incognito, would
exist no longer, if the professors,&mdash;who I hope
may take the hint,&mdash;would make a practice of
giving lessons occasionally with the left hand.
Some of them do so already, and I congratulate
them on their good sense. If you come to
think of it, there is not a single left-handed
thrust or parry, which cannot be equally well
executed by a right-handed player. Only, from
want of practice, the latter finds it more difficult
to direct his point because the lines are reversed.
<i>Quarte</i> becomes <i>sixte</i>, and vice versa. The left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>-hander
prefers to take the inside engagement,
that is to say <i>quarte</i>. This line suits him better,
and accordingly it is good policy not to let him
take it without a struggle. It is usually more
difficult to hit him in the outside line.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So much for general principles, for of
course left-handed play varies as much as right-handed,
although the contrary is sometimes
maintained. But if all left-handers were providentially
made alike, one would think that it
could not be very difficult to get to know the
pattern by heart.</p>

<h3>VIII.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you must admit that in the course of
my remarks I try not to pass over anything
that is likely to interest those who have, or
those who should, could, or would have a fancy
for sword-play.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My object is to bring out the essential
features in clear relief, and I intentionally omit
the thousand and one minute details, which
would overcrowd my canvas, and prevent you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
from properly appreciating the leading features.
These refinements, which come with experience
and habit, cannot be forced, they must be slowly
acquired by the friction of the blades, by meeting
all sorts and conditions of fencers, by facing
the unforeseen and sudden perils, which confront
you just when they are least expected.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know how awkward a young fellow is
when he makes his first appearance in society.
When he finds himself in a drawing-room, he is
shy and uncomfortable, he does not know how
to sit down or how to stand up or how to talk,
but presently without consulting any professor,
simply, so to speak, by the daily friction of his
common intercourse with other people, older
and more experienced than himself, he acquires
confidence, ease, address, manners, and
so forth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is just the same with fencers. Craft,
finesse, tact, and judgment come by degrees, as
wings grow out of feathers; but do not forget
that the lesson and the master&rsquo;s pad are your
first instructors and must not be neglected.
To neglect them would be ungrateful, and ingratitude
is always base. Besides you cannot

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what is your text to-night?&rdquo; asked
my host as he joined the group which
had met as usual in the smoking-room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I have nothing left to preach
about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; said the Marquis de G., who was
looking through the evening paper, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t mean
to let you off so easily. Here is a piece of
news, which is very interesting in connection
with our nightly symposia.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Read it! Read it!&rdquo; exclaimed a chorus
of voices.</p>

<p class="p2">The Marquis read out the following paragraph:&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;An unfortunate encounter recently took
place in the Papal States between the young
Marquis de Monte C. and the Chevalier d&rsquo;A.
The duel arose out of a very singular incident.
The Chevalier d&rsquo;A., a Neapolitan, has the reputation
of a <i>jettatore</i>, that is to say he is
supposed to have the evil eye. The Marquis
de Monte C., happening to meet him in a
drawing-room, took up without thinking a little
coral hand, a charm that he was wearing on his
watch-chain, and pointed it at the Chevalier
d&rsquo;A. as he was passing close by him. The
Chevalier who knew what people thought of
him, noticed the movement and called the young
Marquis out. They met the following morning,
and the unfortunate Marquis received a sword
thrust in the chest and was killed outright.
The Chevalier, besides being a very expert
swordsman, is said to have acquired a knowledge
of several secret thrusts.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>The reading of this paragraph was followed
by a momentary silence. Then someone remarked:&mdash;&ldquo;I
have often heard &lsquo;secret thrusts&rsquo;
spoken of, but how is it that they are not taught
by the Professors?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said smiling, &ldquo;for one sufficient
reason, that if they were taught they would
no longer be secret. But, joking apart, I may
as well say at once that my belief in secret
thrusts is about equal to my belief in ghosts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, this must be looked into.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe in out of the way and unlooked
for strokes, but further than that I cannot go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet, surely they must have existed some
time or other,&rdquo; objected my critic, &ldquo;or how did
they come by their name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, they existed more or less at one time,
or perhaps it would be nearer the mark to say
that they were supposed to exist. They are a
shadowy survival, a sort of family ghost that we
have inherited from the Italian school. For
French fencing, though it has developed characteristic
features of its own, traces its descent,
as you know, in a direct line from Italian
ancestry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Secret thrusts died and were buried when
Science was in its infancy; and Science has
since grown up in other conditions, and grown
strong by working on other lines. They could
not be revived, unless the attendant ritual of an
effete tradition, the system of a bygone age
long since forgotten, were revived along with
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the present day, with our modern
weapons and our modern methods, to use a
secret thrust would amount almost to a crime.
And if it were not exactly that, if a charge of
murder or manslaughter would not lie, it certainly
would be considered iniquitous by all
honourable men. No one with a conscience
could conceivably buy success in an affair of
honour at such a price.</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Before we leave this question I should like
to make my meaning perfectly clear. In the
world as we find it there are some things for
which no definite penalty is prescribed, things
that do not bring a man within the law, but
that are none the less offences in the court of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
conscience and very properly censured. An
action, such as we are now discussing, is to my
mind a case in point, always supposing it to
be a possible action; but is it possible?&mdash;that
is the question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put yourself in the place of a man who is
compelled by force of circumstances to fight a
duel. Your success, if you do succeed, may be
due to the blessing of Providence, to skill, or to
accident, but it must satisfy one condition,&mdash;it
must be unequivocal. You are meeting an
honourable enemy in an honourable fight, and
obviously the means you employ must be beyond
all question &lsquo;straight,&rsquo; and not devices
so crooked as almost to deserve the epithet
&lsquo;felonious.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p2">I found myself speaking with some warmth,
and was pleased to see that my remarks were
received with great interest.</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;in speaking or
writing on a subject of this sort, one can only
express a strictly personal opinion. Now, what
do you say? We have been let in for this duel
by an evening paper. Shall we drop it, or shall
we see it through?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>I was answered by a general cry:&mdash;&ldquo;Go
on!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid it may take us rather far afield,
for it involves important considerations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So much the better,&rdquo; observed my host,
&ldquo;we have plenty of cigars, and the night is
young.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We provided ourselves with fresh cigars to
follow those already alight, and settled down
in our arm-chairs, and the most profound silence
reigned in the smoking-room.</p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I began, &ldquo;hitherto we have had in
view sword-play in the literal sense of the word,
that is to say theoretical fencing, fencing regarded
as a sport, as a bout with the foils in
a fencing room. We shall now have to consider
it from the strictly utilitarian standpoint.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the one case we have an assault, consisting
of a succession of fancy strokes played
by connoisseurs, who in point of skill may of
course be equally or unequally matched, but
who nevertheless play the game on the whole
in accordance with principles that are tolerably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
well ascertained. In the other case we have a
serious encounter with swords sharply pointed,
flashing in the sun, and dangerous to life. The
first hit, correct or incorrect, is decisive, no
matter how it is delivered, no matter where.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not forget that you have to reckon
not only with skill but with the possibility of
surprise, not only with subtlety but with brute
force, not only with science but with blind and
headlong ignorance. Your opponent does not
greatly care whether he lets your blood in
orthodox style, or whether he operates on your
face for instance, or on those parts of the body
that are too much neglected in the fencing room.
You do not choose your opponent, he is chosen
for you by accident; he may be tall or short,
strong or weak. You are no longer engaged in
a sport in which your object is to play correctly,
in a contest of skill in which you may perhaps
allow yourself to be hit occasionally in order to
lead your opponent on and afterwards defeat
him more easily. The man who confronts you
with that threatening point may be an artistic
and accomplished swordsman, but he may
equally well never have touched a sword in his
life, and be trusting to luck, or to his general
smartness, or to a cool head. You may find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
that you have to do with an enemy whose every
movement is studied; who keeps his distance
cleverly; who never advances or retires without
a reason. Or on the contrary, it may turn out
that your opponent, trusting to one supreme
effort of audacity, in defiance of all calculation,
and throwing to the wind every shred of theory,
will make such brutal use of his sword as the
primitive and untutored instinct of self-preservation
dictates.</p>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;We realise at once how far we have got
from the harmless diversion of the assault, the
sham fight conducted under the master&rsquo;s eye on
strictly correct principles and with inoffensive
weapons. The assault and the duel are even
further apart than the assault and the formal
lesson. In short this newspaper paragraph has
brought us face to face with the real duel, and
what we have to do is to discuss it in all its
bearings,&mdash;so we had better begin at the beginning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, one always finds that it is
impossible to discuss the art of fence without
coming to the duel; for say what you will, cases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
must sometimes occur when an affront for which
the law offers no redress compels you to go out.
&lsquo;The duel,&rsquo; as someone puts it, &lsquo;cannot be suppressed.
It is like a bad neighbour with whom
we have to live on the best terms we can.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some years ago I happened to read a great
deal of fencing literature. The various authors,
though not one of them could find a good word
to say for duelling, contrived between them to
fill in a sketch of its rise and progress from the
earliest times down to the present day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is evidently one of the points where
the civilised man and the savage meet on common
ground, and is an instance of the law that
civilisation modifies, refines, perhaps transforms
our instincts, dresses or disguises them in the
latest fashion, but never gets rid of them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At one time the duel was called Trial by
Battle or simply The Judicial Combat. Then
it was pronounced illegal, and those who fought
in a private quarrel were sentenced either to
death or to long and cruel periods of imprisonment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At a later period, growing insolent with
impunity, the duel like a strayed reveller swaggered
in the streets and public places; we find
it haunting the taverns, we see the flicker of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
blades under a street lamp,&mdash;drawn for a word,
for a ribbon, for a bet, for anything, or for
nothing. Even the seconds who parted good
friends over-night did their best to spit each
other next morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what better evidence could we require
to prove that this last resort of wounded honour
is somehow deeply rooted in human nature, than
the fact that the ancient and honourable practice
of duelling has remained the final court of appeal,
in spite of changed surroundings, in spite
of hostile opinion, and in spite of the extravagant
follies that have sometimes disgraced it?</p>

<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;But this is a digression for which I apologise.
I was led astray by my subject and
drifted quite unconsciously into an unpremeditated
preface.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t apologise,&rdquo; said M. de C., &ldquo;your
digression is charming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And besides,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;you know I
have a sort of moral claim on your indulgence,
for I might have displayed my erudition, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
have quoted names and dates and facts unearthed
from dusty folios, and yet I have
mercifully spared you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you, thank you!&rdquo; came from
several arm-chairs.</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;When one talks of duelling, there is a
point that strikes one at the outset, and though
it is not directly connected with sword-play, it
is too nearly allied to the duel to be dismissed
without notice. I mean the duties of seconds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall not now enter upon the question of
what those duties may be before the combatants
meet. These consist in pressing for moderate
counsels, in acting or even over-acting the part
of peacemaker. You all know as well as I do
that no chance of arriving at an honourable
settlement should be neglected before allowing
your men to go out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What should we think of the man who
could forget that his friend&rsquo;s honour and his
friend&rsquo;s life are equally committed to his keeping,
and that he ought not, out of a quixotic
regard for the one, to jeopardise the other
needlessly?</p>

<p>&ldquo;When a man fights, his conviction that
right is on his side is everything. And there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>fore
the correct attitude of a second is that of
a man, who acting calmly but firmly in his
friend&rsquo;s interest seeks to avoid a quarrel. Any
other attitude is not only incorrect but even
renders him liable to be called to account for
neglecting his bounden duty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Personally, if after exhausting every effort
to obtain a friendly settlement I found that
a meeting was unavoidable, although I was
thoroughly satisfied in my own mind that it
was a case not of injured honour but only of
injured vanity, or of wounded pride, I should
not hesitate to withdraw. Duels played to the
gallery are either odious or absurd; they are
out of date, and should be numbered with the
obsolete fashions of the past.</p>

<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;They arose in the manners and customs
of a flamboyant era, when everyone carried a
sword and it was considered the right thing to
air it on every opportunity, in order to fill up
the time which might otherwise have passed
somewhat heavily. Every age has its fashions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
and its vices, its childish toys and favourite
follies. Those gallant blades that cut such a
tremendous figure in the old days would meet
with a very poor reception now, if they could
revisit the scenes of their dashing exploits.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if it is the duty of a second to play the
part of mediator before the action, it is equally
his duty to be cool and collected on the ground.
His personal responsibility is increased, but
otherwise his rôle remains unchanged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It then becomes imperative on him to
anticipate and allow for every contingency, he
must let nothing escape him, and must give the
closest attention to the minutest detail, in order
that his principal may be relieved of all anxiety,
and may preserve that cool presence of mind
which is so absolutely indispensable.</p>

<h3>VIII.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;In short the fact that has to be grasped is
simply this,&mdash;that not one of the thousand and
one preliminary details is unimportant; and
that things seemingly the most trivial may
suddenly assume the most unexpected gravity.
The stake is too high to justify any man in
gambling it away with a light heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;In the first place the selection of the
ground must be carefully considered. The
surface should be smooth and even, without
dips or inequalities that can be in the slightest
degree dangerous. Be particular to avoid a
spot where there is any grass. Grass is slippery
and may imperil your friend&rsquo;s life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here is another point worth remembering.
Run your eye quickly but carefully over the
ground where your friend will stand; he is very
likely to neglect this precaution himself, and
may fail to see a root for instance, almost unnoticeable
to a careless glance, which might very
easily trip him up or throw him off his guard at
a critical moment, when it was too late to stay
the impetus of his opponent&rsquo;s point. All this no
doubt seems extremely trivial; but how do you
know that the tuft of wet slippery grass, the half
hidden root, or treacherous stone will not turn
the scale a moment later?</p>

<p>&ldquo;The contending parties, it has been said,
are entitled to a fair division of light and ground.
If that is so, you will be well advised not to
stand out for your share of light, and you should
never consent to let your principal face the sun.
The glitter of the blades confuses the eye and
causes hesitation. Remember that in fighting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
the eye is an implement at least as important as
the sword. Seeing in this case is thinking. The
eye warns you of danger, and instinctively picks
out the enemy&rsquo;s weak spot. And more than
that, a steady eye, an eye that looks one in
the face unflinchingly, overawes and fascinates.
While the sword threatens, the spying questioning
eye is the intelligent scout.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Again, never allow the combatants to strip.
The impression of the cold air on the bare skin
and the unaccustomed exposure may affect one
more than the other, if he is naturally more
sensitive, even though he may be quite unconscious
of the fact.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; objected the Comte de R., &ldquo;what if
the other side insist?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must refuse to give way. No one has
a right to insist upon it. It is a barrack-room
practice, usual among soldiers, and does not hold
good outside the guard-room.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>IX.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;While we are on this point,&rdquo; remarked one
of my friends, &ldquo;there are two questions I should
like to ask you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I will do my best to answer them,&rdquo; I replied,
&ldquo;for&mdash;as my lawyer would put it&mdash;I may say,
that I am thoroughly acquainted with all the
leading cases.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, is it allowable to use a fencing glove?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is usual. But custom is not always right,
and though many men suppose that they are
entitled to it as a matter of course, they cannot
strictly speaking claim it. Generally the parties
agree beforehand whether fencing gloves shall
be used or not. It nearly always happens that
both sides prefer to use them, for with the help
of a fencing glove you get a firmer and more
confident grip of the sword, and are less likely
to be disarmed. Besides, the hilt of a sword is
hard; it tires and bruises the hand; the fingers
in contact with it are jarred at every parry that
is at all strong, or whenever the blades meet
sharply. On these grounds fencing gloves are
generally allowed. However, if the seconds of
one side object, the seconds of the other side
cannot either require them to use a fencing
glove or claim the right for their own principal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For instance, the objection may be raised
that the use of a fencing glove is familiar to a
man accustomed to fencing, but unfamiliar and
of no value to one who has never fenced. True,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
this objection is seldom raised, because, as I
pointed out just now, the man who is not used
to fencing is of all men the one who finds a
serious difficulty in handling the rough hilt of
a sword, and who has everything to gain by
using a padded glove.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In any case you are at liberty to wear an
ordinary leather glove, whether your opponent
chooses to do so or not. Or you may wrap a
handkerchief round your hand, to give you a
firmer grip of the sword, provided you are
careful not to leave a hanging end, which may
dangle loose, and hinder the action of your
opponent&rsquo;s point.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>X.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;I will now put my second question,&rdquo; continued
my inquisitor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what is your second question?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it permissible to use the unarmed hand
to parry and put aside your opponent&rsquo;s blade?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! that is a very serious matter, which I
did not mean to pass over in silence. But it
involves the consideration of several points,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
which would perhaps take us too far to-night.
Suppose we leave it for to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we adjourn until to-morrow,&rdquo; said
the Comte de C.</p>

<p>And so we broke up.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>A Parry with the hand.</i></p>
</div>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;You asked me yesterday, if it is allowable
to use the unarmed hand to parry and
put aside the sword.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My answer is very emphatic:&mdash;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;But what if the parties agree to allow it
beforehand?&rdquo; asked the Marquis de R....</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;That is an agreement which in my opinion
ought not to be made. The practice is wholly
foreign to our ways and to the traditions that
have come down to us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I am fully aware of the fact that there is
the authority of a very profound writer, the
Comte de Chatauvillard, who has many strong
supporters, for the statement that &lsquo;the parry
with the hand may be a matter of agreement.&rsquo;
And other writers, among whom is more than
one eminent master, may be quoted for the
view that it is a proper matter for arrangement
between the contending parties. That does not
affect my opinion in the least; and I say very
emphatically and very distinctly:&mdash;As you
clearly have the right to say yes or no, say no
invariably.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such a concession or such an agreement,
even if it is freely entered upon by both sides,
is only too likely to lead to disastrous and
fatal mistakes, while it does not offer any
counterbalancing advantage. I will try to explain
why.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The parry made with the hand that does
not hold the sword goes back to the ancient
traditions of the Italian school, to the methods
in vogue when men fought with sword and
dagger. They parried and attacked with either
weapon indifferently, bringing one or other into
play by voltes and passes, which have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
dismissed from the theory and practice of
modern fencing. The art, which was adapted
in those days to the double means of offence
and defence, employed a system very different
from that which prevails now. This parry, or to
speak more accurately this method of diverting
an opponent&rsquo;s blade, which was done with either
hand indifferently, was reasonable then; nowadays
it would be a fantastic and dangerous
anomaly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember trying by way of experiment,
some years ago at Naples, several assaults of
this sort with an Italian professor, named Parisi.&mdash;The
poor fellow died I believe in prison, after
taking part in one of the many revolutionary
attempts that were made to wreck the kingdom
of Naples. Parisi used to come regularly to my
house where I had furnished a room for fencing.
I wished to make a serious study of Italian play,
and of the surviving traditions of this school,
which is rapidly disappearing and is only connected
with its past by a few almost invisible
threads.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Parisi used to fence with a long
Italian sword in one hand, and in the other a
sort of stiletto, which he employed to parry my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
attacks in certain lines; and while he thus
stopped my attack with his dagger, he made
not exactly a riposte but rather a simultaneous
counter-attack on me with his sword. This
kind of play, which continually produced new
and difficult situations, was very interesting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Parisi dropped his dagger, what happened?
His left hand, instead of following my
blade, sprang at once to a fixed position. And
to what position? Why, you could see at a
glance, by the way he carried his forearm,
thrown rather high across his chest and only
a few inches away from it, that he was ready
for the parry with the hand, in fact doubly ready
for it, both by the position of his body and by
the forward position of his left arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now we who follow the rules of French
fencing do just the reverse. We carry our left
arm to the rear, and so leave a smaller surface
exposed to our opponent&rsquo;s point; we therefore
cannot bring our left hand into play without
abandoning the French position, or at all events
without sacrificing some of its fundamental
principles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;It is a good many years since I first took
up fencing; I have been in all the fencing-rooms;
I have fenced with many professors
and with all sorts and conditions of amateurs,
and no one has ever suggested to me that we
should agree to parry with the hand. I have
never, no not once in all the assaults that I
have witnessed, heard such a suggestion made;
I have never seen this kind of parry employed;
I have never heard of a master showing or
teaching it to his pupils as a possible case or
even as a highly improbable case, against which
it was his duty, as a wise and experienced
professor, to put on their guard those whose
instruction was committed to his care.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why, when the assault ceases to be
an exercise or an amusement, why, when you
stake your life upon the issue, should you go
out of your way to suggest or assent to something
foreign to all recognised practice?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;If you approve of the surviving methods of
the old Italian school, you should admit all the
precepts of that school, and then you will at
least be logical.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your sword will have a long heavy blade,
broad and perfectly rigid; the hilt will be
surmounted by a little cross-bar of steel on
which you will place your fingers, and to which
you will attach them with a long ribbon; incidentally
you will do away with the freedom of
the hand, the supple action of the wrist and the
niceties of finger play. You will have to make
frequent use of parries of contraction, which are
indispensable to Italian play, though they are
little valued, not to say altogether ignored by
the French school. You must learn your voltes
and passes, the manoeuvres of ducking and
dodging; and then, I repeat, you will at least
be logical. But an agreement which recognises
only one of these practices, while it disregards
all the rest, seems to me absurd.</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;Let me now show you the danger, which
can hardly be avoided, of admitting this parry
with the left hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Between the open palm, which merely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
brushes the blade aside, and the hand, which by
a nervous movement closes unconsciously on
the blade and holds it fast, the difference is
very hard to seize. The thing is done in a
moment. It passes like a flash in the confusion
of the encounter and leaves no trace behind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Without a doubt the man who has unconsciously
arrested the blade, instead of merely
turning it aside, will be in despair, and in the
loyalty of his heart will be the first to accuse
himself. But if his point has taken effect, if he
has delivered a fatal thrust, will his despair or
regret or any self-reproach heal the wound that
he has inflicted, or restore the life that he has
taken? If the odds were a thousand to one
against a fatal issue, that one chance would
be enough to condemn fatally this dangerous
agreement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Moreover, I may remark, speaking from the
experience that is obtained by long familiarity,
and perhaps from some small skill in the practice
of arms, that it is often very difficult, not to say
impossible, for the most practised eye in the
confusion of a multitude of thrusts, swiftly
parried and as swiftly returned, to follow with
accuracy the course of two swords, that pass to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
and fro and interlace like living things, or to
judge with indisputable certainty the difference
between these two movements, one of which is
authorised by consent, while the other may
suddenly turn an honourable fight into a foul
assassination.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The mere act of judging so bristles with
difficulties, that it is likely to lead to a conflict
of opinion between even the most unbiassed
judges. Who can decide between them? The
fact on which their judgment is based is there
no longer. It passed in a moment, quick as
thought. Consider the terrible position in which
you are placed, in the presence of a man lying
stretched on the ground before you, cold and
lifeless, who ought to be a living man full of
strength and vigour.</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;And now, I appeal to all seconds. In the
name of good sense, in common fairness, could
you or could you not with a clear conscience
take the heavy responsibility of such a risk?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;I am trying, you see, to obtain a comprehensive
view of the manifold duties of seconds,
and to omit none of the minute matters of detail,
which it is their duty to attend to, and which
ought to be present to their minds. Here is
another point, which is worthy of their serious
attention.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When the combatants have taken sword in
hand and the blades are crossed, the seconds
should stand within reach, holding a sword or
walking-stick, and ready to stop the fight should
any irregularity occur, or if either of the men
should slip, or stumble, or be disarmed, or
wounded. This last case especially requires
their utmost vigilance, for there are two events,
both equally disastrous, that may occur.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose one of the men is wounded. In
the natural excitement of the moment, the man
who has delivered the thrust is often unaware
that his point has taken effect. Before he can
tell that his opponent is disabled, perhaps before
he can check himself, he may inflict a second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
wound, unless the swords are instantly knocked
up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The wounded man, on the other hand, may
not immediately feel the effect of his wound,
and by continuing to fight may run the risk of
being wounded a second time, and that more
seriously. It may also happen, and this is the
great danger, that in a fit of blind rage he will
rush madly on his opponent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Again, the man who has inflicted a wound
and has felt his point go home, instantly and
instinctively stays his hand, and even if his
opponent renews the attack hesitates to strike a
second time one who is already hurt. It is
during this juncture of a moment&rsquo;s pause with a
moment&rsquo;s hesitation that the wounded man may
make his mad rush, and either run his opponent
through the body, or meet his own destruction,
if his opponent has promptly recovered his guard,
and calmly offers him his point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Both cases are alike disastrous, for either
may lead to a fatal result at a time when by
the wound already received the fight may be
regarded as closed, or at least as suspended.
The seconds, who by redoubling their precautions
might have saved the useless shedding of blood,
will of course be held to blame.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No doubt it sometimes happens that in
spite of the closest attention the attack is so
prompt, so impetuous, so swift, that it is impossible
to intervene in time. But then at all
events the seconds will have no cause for self-reproach.
Fortunately such cases are of very
rare occurrence, but they do sometimes happen;
and it is therefore very necessary for the seconds
to watch the crossed swords incessantly, and
to follow their every movement, in order to
intervene the moment that one of the men is
wounded, however slight the wound may seem.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If on examination the wound is found to
be so trivial that the fight can continue without
disadvantage to the wounded man, the com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>batants
will at least have had time to recover
their coolness and self-possession.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This close attention is one of the most
important points; it is in fact a matter of
absolute necessity. Here is the seconds&rsquo; real
difficulty, for here the whole responsibility rests
with them.</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;I have still several things to say, of which
you will recognise the importance. But it is
getting late, and if you will allow me I will
postpone them to our next meeting.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="caption"><i>Corps à Corps.</i></p>
</div>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; remarked the Comte de C..., when
we met the next day, &ldquo;that you would tell
us what you think of the <i>corps à corps</i> in the
duel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;is the very thing I was
going to talk about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The right course in my opinion is to come
to an agreement with the seconds of the other
side that the combatants shall be separated and
start afresh, when they become entangled at close
quarters in what is termed a <i>corps à corps</i>. Otherwise,
in a struggle of this sort it is impossible to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
say what may happen, except that both men are
likely to receive their quietus,&mdash;a very symmetrical
settling of their accounts by the process
of double entry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But here again, one cannot help feeling that
we have another thorny case, which calls for the
exercise of judgment with due regard to the
circumstances of the moment and fair play for
both sides.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If one of the men makes a furious rush on
the other, the seconds ought not to knock up
the swords until the man who has stood the
attack has delivered his riposte. For he has
gained this clear advantage, that after stopping
the rush he is prepared with an effective rejoinder,
and this advantage he is clearly entitled
to use.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Many questions of duelling must be left to
the impartial discretion of the seconds. There
is therefore no need to consider what would
happen, if a second were to take unfair advantage
of an agreement, honourably entered into on
both sides, by interfering when the case expressly
provided for had not arisen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, but suppose such a thing did happen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, then, your conscience must tell you
how to act. Perhaps you might interfere sum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>marily
to stop the proceedings, if the nature of
the quarrel allowed it, or you might call upon
the second who had so misconstrued his duty
to withdraw and take no further part in the
affair.</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;I have often heard men say:&mdash;&lsquo;If I were
acting second in an affair that was not so serious
as to warrant a fatal issue, and were to see that
my principal was about to be run through the
body by a thrust that would certainly be fatal,
I should not hesitate to knock up the swords.
I could not resist the temptation; my feelings
would be too strong for me. And as a matter
of fact should I be very far wrong?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my friend, you would be absolutely
wrong. You would be assuming the most
onerous, the most terrible responsibility, and
your action, though dictated by a praiseworthy
impulse, would probably cause you the most
bitter remorse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For consider:&mdash;you have arrested the sword
which would have struck one of the opponents
full in the body. The fight continues, and the
man whose blow you intercepted with the praiseworthy
motive, I quite admit, of preventing a
mortal wound, is himself wounded or possibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
killed. Fortune which favoured him at the outset
suddenly turns against him and favours his
opponent, perhaps with a lucky fluke, a thing
which no foresight can prevent. What would
your feelings be, when you saw stretched at
your feet a man whose death you had caused
by exposing him to a danger that he ought
never to have encountered?</p>

<p>&ldquo;A duel is always a miserable business; but
when once you have faithfully and energetically
done all that you can to prevent it, you must
leave chance to decide between the combatants;
only see that you take all the measures that are
in your power to minimise the chances of a fatal
issue.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; someone remarked, &ldquo;that
if, when a friend asks you to oblige him with
your services, one were to think of all these
innumerable responsibilities, one would invariably
decline to act.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether one would always
decline, but I know very well that the second&rsquo;s
part is one of unsparing self-sacrifice and devotion.
I know that the man who undertakes it
lightly cannot be too severely blamed, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
may add that I have never accepted the charge
without passing a sleepless night haunted by
the most gloomy forebodings. The second who
conceives that he is merely required to be a
passive witness, robs the part of all its meaning,
all its value, all its dignity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You remember, I was speaking just now of
the case of a second who acting on the spur of
the moment instinctively intercepts a blow. I
will give you an experience of my own.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was once acting for a friend in an affair
of honour; I was thoroughly on the alert and
carefully following the play of the points with
that close attention, and perhaps I may say with
that sureness of eye, which one acquires from
some familiarity with sword-play, when I saw
the opponent&rsquo;s point coming straight at my
friend&rsquo;s body. Before I could think, I saw in
an instant, as no one accustomed to fencing
could fail to see, that the wound would be
mortal. I knocked up the swords, and as the two
men had got to close quarters, I called out:&mdash;&lsquo;On
guard.&rsquo; But I had hardly done so, when
I realised the full extent of my unconsidered
action, and I felt&mdash;well, I really cannot tell you
what my feelings were at that moment. Luckily
for me, my friend, who was no less clumsy than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
brave, was not the man to leave me long in
this cruel position. He fell a few seconds later
seriously wounded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The simple fact is, that where so many
considerations have to be taken into account,
you cannot be too careful never to go a step
beyond the limits of strict and unassailable
justice, in fairness to yourself and to everyone
else concerned.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;In this connection I am reminded of another
case, which not unfrequently occurs, and on which
I have sometimes heard the most contradictory
opinions expressed, for it presents a really difficult
problem.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the course of the fight one of the antagonists
calls for a halt&mdash;have you the right
to insist that the fight shall continue without
interruption?</p>

<p>&ldquo;In my opinion you unquestionably have
that right, unless the case has been already
provided for, or both men consent.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;Still surely,&rdquo; said the Comte de C..., &ldquo;in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
prolonged set-to, if your opponent is exhausted,
if he is so done that he can hardly hold his
sword, if he is blown and distressed, you cannot
refuse to give him a minute or two to
recover his wind.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I have stated what I
believe to be the rights of the case, on which
either combatant can fairly insist. I will now
give you my reasons.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your opponent, you say, is done; well,
perhaps he may be, but have you considered
why? Is not his fatigue due to the violence
and the excessive energy with which he began
the fight, to the regardless eagerness with which
he has assailed you, without consulting his staying
powers or husbanding his strength? You
have had to bear the brunt of all this fury, you
have sustained incessant attacks, but you with
more skill have economised your resources and
have bided your time to attack him. That
opportune moment evidently comes just when
your opponent, exhausted by the failure of his
repeated attacks, is likely to offer you the least
resistance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then what happens? He calls for a halt!
And are you to let him off without pressing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
advantage that you with your judgment and
self-restraint have held in reserve? Are you to
give him leave to recover his wind, that is to
say to recover his strength and rally his scattered
forces, in order that he may start afresh to make
a second onset with the same ardour and the
same violence as before? The danger that
you have safely encountered once may prove
too much for you the second time. How does
that strike you? Surely it is as though a man,
engaged in a duel with pistols, in which each
party is at liberty to fire when he chooses, were
to be in too great hurry to let fly at his opponent,
and then, when his barrels were emptied and
useless, were to ask permission to reload, before
he has received his opponent&rsquo;s fire.</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Situations requiring nerve and self-control
undoubtedly occur in a duel with pistols, but
similar situations, more trying and more critical,
occur in a duel with swords. You are willing to
admit them in the one case, yet you refuse to
admit them in the other.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;But, after all,&rdquo; persisted my critic, &ldquo;you can
hardly strike a man, who is so utterly done that
he can hardly keep his point up.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;Quite true; but do you feel that hesitation,
when you raise your pistol to fire on a man who
has emptied his barrels? Do you not say, and
with perfect justice, &lsquo;I have stood his fire, it is
his turn now to stand mine&rsquo;? Yet the cases are
strictly parallel. In each case you have taken
the risk and have escaped unhurt, and the
empty pistol in your opponent&rsquo;s hand is more
completely spent than a sword in a hand that
is nerveless from fatigue. For no power can
recharge the pistol with the ball that has sped,
but on the contrary a man with a sword in his
hand may possibly by a supreme effort pull himself
together, and dangerous to the last strike
you before you can strike him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But here, as usual, fashion refuses to be
logical, and the sentiment of chivalry, which
we look for in all right-minded men, does not
nowadays allow us to make use of an advantage,
which some day or other, perhaps in precisely
identical circumstances, may very likely be
claimed without scruple.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;There is, by the way, another argument
which I remember was once put to me by a
friend, and which struck me forcibly at the time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My friend, who is something of a scholar,
and has not forgotten his Latin, quoted these
lines from Virgil:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ille pedum melior motu fretusque iuventa;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hic membris et mole valens; sed tarda trementi<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Genua labant, vastos quatit aeger anhelitus artus<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>&ldquo;These verses describe the fighting qualities
of two heroes, who are about to enter the ring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one, I suppose, would seriously maintain
that they ought to be handicapped, that one of
them should be made to concede some points in
which he is superior, that is to say some of the
chances in his favour, while the other retains all
that he can muster. And yet can we not easily
imagine two men meeting to fight a duel, one
of whom has in his favour every chance but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
one, advantage of reach, dexterity, speed, and
swordsmanship, while the other relies only on
sound condition and great staying power?</p>

<p>&ldquo;In an unequal combat such as this, what
can the latter do but tire his opponent out, get
him thoroughly well blown, and so reduce the
balance of advantage, which until then tells
with full force against him? The other man
who thereupon calls for a truce is practically
asking his antagonist to forgo his superiority
of sound wind and limb, while he, so far from
giving up his own advantages of reach, dexterity,
and science, has every intention of making the
most of them when the fight begins afresh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then again, the staying power which you
handicap, is very likely derived from a well developed
chest which incidentally offers a larger
target to the adverse point; the greater vigour
may be due to the fact that its owner is thick-set,
with heavy muscular limbs which make his
movements slow and ponderous. Why recognise
the inequality of the match in the one case, and
disregard it in the other?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose, added my friend, that the question
is discussed by the seconds before the
fight begins. One side might say:&mdash;&lsquo;If our man
is tired or blown, you will have no objection, we
presume, to allowing a short interval?&rsquo; &lsquo;We
cannot agree to that,&rsquo; the other side would reply.
&lsquo;The only chance we have of making an even
fight of it is that our man should outstay yours.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If they insist, the answer is this:&mdash;&lsquo;Your
man has every acquired advantage, ours has
only the one advantage of superior physique.
If we are to give up our points, you must forfeit
yours, and how can you?&rsquo;&mdash;Some arguments are
so one-sided.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In conclusion, I think that such questions
may very properly be debated between the
seconds, but that they ought never to come to
the ears of the principals, for one of them might
seem to be asking a favour, which the other
would have a perfect right to refuse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel that I have dwelt on this matter
at great length, but I was anxious to sift it
thoroughly, because it is of vital importance
and has often given rise to a serious conflict of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
opinions. I have tried to give you the rights
of the case in a strictly impartial spirit. Exceptional
cases may occur, to which the rule cannot
be applied without hardship, but such circumstances,
as for example the bad health or feeble
constitution of one of the combatants, should be
provided for by arrangement.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;One more question, please,&rdquo; continued the
Comte de C., &ldquo;just to complete my cross-examination.
When a man is called out, can
he be required to fight two duels with two
opponents in succession?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, that cannot be expected of him. The
man who has fought once ought to be treated
as a privileged person, and cannot in any case
be compelled to cross swords a second time.
Tired as he is, or as he may be by the first
encounter, he stands at a disadvantage in meeting
a fresh antagonist. A second encounter, if
it cannot be avoided and if both sides consent,
ought not to take place until the next day, or
after an interval of at least some hours, unless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
the party interested, that is to say the man who
has already fought, requests that it may take
place at once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But on no account should the man, who at
a later stage may probably or possibly become
a principal, witness the first encounter either as
a simple spectator or as a second. For the mere
fact of his presence gives him a real and indisputable
advantage, especially if the duel is
fought with swords. And then the first law of
the duel,&mdash;that it should be a fair fight with no
favour,&mdash;is broken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is one case and strictly speaking only
one, in which his presence is permissible. That
is, when being the party injured and therefore
having the choice of weapons he selects different
weapons from those employed in the first encounter,&mdash;pistols
for example, if the former fight
was with swords, or swords if it was fought with
pistols. But, I repeat, this can only be allowed,
if the man who has already fought wishes it or
consents to it freely. In any other circumstances
if I were acting second on an occasion
of this sort, I should refuse to countenance a
duel which I should consider equally irregular
and unfair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Take the question on its merits. In a duel
with swords there are two things you want to
know: first, what is your opponent&rsquo;s natural
temper, when he is fighting in earnest; secondly,
what is the character of his play and the quality
of his swordsmanship. No one can deny that it
is very advantageous to know, whether the man
that you have to face is impatient and excitable
or self-possessed and cool; whether he will
attack you with resolution or play a waiting
game; whether he will attempt to parry or
simply offer his point; whether he is energetic
or the reverse, skilful or clumsy, an ugly customer
or not particularly formidable. The fact
of your presence at a previous encounter is
sufficient by itself to give you information on all
these heads. You are reassured and reinforced;
undisturbed by doubt and hesitation you can
mature your plans at leisure with a quiet mind.
You have been over the ground and know how
the land lies. Even if you have not the vaguest
notion of fencing, if your ignorance is so complete
that you are not in a position to make the
best use of all this valuable information, still the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
fact that you have been a spectator of the first
fight, apart from any conclusions you may draw,
robs of its imaginary terrors the great unknown,
and shows you what you have to do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your antagonist on the contrary has everything
to learn. He does not know whether you
are skilful or incompetent; whether he ought to
attack you or to wait for your attack; whether
your nerves are shaky or firm; whether you are
naturally cool or excitable. He is in the dark,
a stranger feeling his way in a new country.
You, meanwhile, having no need to waste time
on such deliberations, go to work at once, with
every probability of winning an easy victory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Therefore, just as in the case of the man
who is at a disadvantage in point of science and
practice, but superior in bodily strength, soundness
of wind, and condition, I maintained that
he has as much right to make full use of those
advantages as his opponent has to use those
which he possesses, so in the situation we are
now considering, I maintain that we must refuse
to allow anything that goes to handicap the
combatants, or tends to incline the scales unfairly
on one side rather than the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may be that some of the considerations,
that I have put forward, have not occurred to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
you before. But now, bearing them in mind,
can you say that you really and truly believe
that such a fight as this is a fair fight, or that
you would consent to have anything to do
with it?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think that I have said everything that I
had to say on the duties of seconds, as they
appear to me in the light of my own experience
and of the history of the subject. To-morrow
we will discuss a still more important matter,
the methods to be adopted by the principals.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>The next day found us lighting our cigars
as usual. Brilliant conversation, you know,
cannot be maintained without something to
smoke. Our talk this evening was to be about
the methods of attack and defence, which offer
the most likely chances of success in an actual
duel.</p>

<p>I began at once:&mdash;&ldquo;Yesterday,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I
was speaking of the whole duty of seconds. I
endeavoured to describe as clearly and fully as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
possible, what they ought to do and provide for,
and I showed why it is essential that they
should follow every stage and every incident
of the fight with the utmost keenness, for the
onus of responsibility is rightly held to rest on
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The preliminaries are now settled; the
antagonists, armed with swords of equal length,
stand face to face. One of the seconds is
stationed between them. He addresses to each
in turn the venerable formula:&mdash;&lsquo;Are you
ready?&mdash;On guard.&rsquo; Upon their assenting he
steps back and gives the fatal word:&mdash;&lsquo;Go.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fighting is about to begin, and the two
men stand expectant, neither stirring yet, each
sheltering his life behind a few inches of cold
steel.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;There are only three contingencies that
we need consider, which naturally divide the
discussion under three heads. The first arises,
when a man who has never touched a sword
finds himself opposed to an old hand. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
second, when both antagonists are alike unskilled.
The third, when both are adepts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I may say at once with regard to this
last case, that in a duel between two skilful
opponents the advantage of superior science
which one or the other of them may possess
vanishes more often than not, and is compensated
for by difference of temperament. For
I cannot remind you too often, that in actual
fighting it is not a question of hitting your
opponent often, or of placing your point artistically,
but of striking somehow and anyhow
one blow and only one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Swords are not worn now, and swordsmanship
as a necessary part of polite education
has gone out of fashion. Our more punctilious
ancestors prided themselves on never wounding
their antagonist except with some thrust ingeniously
conceived and brilliantly executed.
Perhaps it was better so. It was certainly more
picturesque, more chivalrous and magnificent.
To mistake your sword for a spit, though
you might succeed in running your antagonist
through and through, would have been voted a
blackguardly proceeding, unworthy of a gentleman.
Molière&rsquo;s principle is good enough for
us:&mdash;&lsquo;<i>Hit the other man, and don&rsquo;t be hit your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>self.</i>&rsquo;
Our object is to hit no matter where,&mdash;no
matter how. The art of fence is now so much
neglected that it seldom happens when two
men go out to fight, that they have even a
passable knowledge of their weapon.</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;When a man knows nothing about fencing,
either because he has never touched a sword, or
because he has only knocked about with his
friends in a rough way and very occasionally,
his first thought when he has to fight is to call
on a professor, and endeavour to obtain some
ideas which will enable him to defend himself
on the field of battle. I will describe one of
these lessons which the professor is expected to
give, and I shall try to point out the only sort
of advice that is of universal application in such
cases.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The novice explains that he has to go out
the next morning, and requests the professor to
be good enough to give him a hint or two.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">&lsquo;Do you know anything about fencing?&rsquo;
enquires the professor.</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, practically nothing.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You know that one holds the sword by the
hilt and tries to hit the other man with the
point, and that is about all, I suppose,&rsquo; continues
the professor, who will have his little joke.
And he takes down a pair of swords provided
with buttons, hands one to his pupil, and the
lesson begins.</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;One wonders how often this same lesson
has been repeated. It never varies, and it never
ought to vary. Its whole value lies in its simplicity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ignorant fencer can do nothing without
a cool head and steady nerve, which are the
more effective, when they are opposed, as they
often are, to bluster and over-confidence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;First and foremost the professor must make
his pupil understand the absolute necessity of
standing firmly on his feet with an easy balance
that allows perfect freedom of movement. The
position, whatever it may be, that your extempore
pupil falls into naturally, is the position
you must accept. It is important to give him
confidence in it and to modify it only so far as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
is absolutely necessary to enable him to move
about easily. Your business is to make the
best of this position, and if possible turn even
its defects to account.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The body should be inclined forwards
rather than backwards. In this somewhat
crouching attitude the upper part of the body,
that is to say the chest, by its advanced position
with the sword arm held in front, acts as a kind
of natural rampart or shield to cover the lower
part, where a wound is almost certain to prove
mortal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep in view from the very first the importance
of inspiring confidence in the unpractised
fencer. For confidence alone implies some sort
of self-possession and reacts immediately on
nerve and muscle. He soon begins to feel
somewhat more at ease. Some slight modifications
are all that is required to correct the
glaring faults that are most obviously dangerous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not afraid of putting the truth of my
statement to a practical test. If you will now,
all of you, take one of those swords which I see
hanging on the wall and place yourselves on
guard, not in what you imagine to be a fencing
attitude, but as you would stand if you were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
seriously threatened, you will find that the attitudes
you assume will all be very much alike,
apart from such slight variations as are due to
differences of physique.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Come, I&rsquo;ll be your shocking example,&rdquo; said
one of my hearers. &ldquo;I have never touched a
sword in my life. See what you can make of
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; I replied, rising as I spoke;
and taking down a pair of swords I handed him
one. Then without giving him time to think, I
made a quick movement and threatened him
with the point.</p>

<p>Instinctively he threw himself on guard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, that will do,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;stay as you
are; I only wish you could be photographed to
illustrate the instinctive attitude. Oh, don&rsquo;t be
too conceited; I do not mean to say that your
position is faultless,&mdash;very far from that; but
the attitude in which you are standing is the
origin of the orthodox guard as taught in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
fencing-room, because it is essentially the attitude
that accords with our natural fighting
instincts.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;I am getting tired of this,&rdquo; observed my
patient, who had scrupulously stuck to his
position.</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;One moment,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;You are tired
because your arm is too much extended. Draw
it back a trifle, to relax the muscles and give
them their natural play. Carry yourself more
upright by slightly raising the body. Your left
foot is too far from the right; bring it rather
more forward; sink down a little on your legs,
so as to be ready either to spring quickly to the
rear or to advance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bring your right shoulder forward, in order
to expose your chest less, but not further than
you can manage with comfort. You see I am
not very exacting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, that will do very well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, if I make a movement, straighten
your arm boldly, and step back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well done.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yet you tell me you have never touched
a sword, or even a foil in a fencing-room. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
all I can say is that I could not have chosen a
better subject for my demonstration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will now put the swords back in their
place, and return to our discussion. Perhaps I
may have occasion to trouble you again by and
by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am entirely at your disposal, Professor,&rdquo;
replied my obliging pupil.</p>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;The rest of the lesson may be summed up
in a convenient formula. For so far as I know,
there is only one really useful tip that a professor
can give to the uninstructed novice who says:&mdash;&lsquo;This
afternoon or to-morrow morning I have
to go out.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The professor will make a great mistake if
he attempts to teach him some fancy stroke, for
he will only disturb the natural working of his
instinct, without controlling it. He must remember
that the excitement of fighting does
not leave much room for thought, and he must
accordingly take care to limit his instruction to
the simplest and clearest ideas, easy to understand
and easy to put into practice, such as arise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
naturally out of the instinctive sense of self-preservation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These remarks of course do not apply to
those dull and inert creatures, cursed with a
temperament so heavy, and so sluggish, that they
do not know what it is to move briskly and can
never rise to the occasion. You can put nothing
into such as these and can get nothing out of
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When swords are crossed, the thing to do
is simply what our friend here did just now:&mdash;Retire.
I say &lsquo;retire&rsquo; in order to avoid saying
&lsquo;run away.&rsquo; Retire always, retire incessantly,
but retire little by little, so as not to consume
once and for all the entire <i>hinterland</i>; retire in
short, not like a man in a panic, but like one
who is watching his opportunity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never forget this,&mdash;the only principle that
at the critical moment is available for him who
cannot count on science to assist him:&mdash;<i>Get back
and straighten the arm</i>;&mdash;or in other words:&mdash;<i>Defend
yourself by threatening your opponent</i>.
Never attack; that is the point on which your
attention must be concentrated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; exclaimed one of my hearers, &ldquo;what
do you mean by &lsquo;threatening?&rsquo; It is not so easy
to threaten when you are an absolute duffer.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;The naked point of a sword resolutely
offered at the body or at the face is always a
threat. No one who sees it directed straight at
him with a set fixity of purpose and a suggestive
glitter can fail to be alarmed by it or can afford
to disregard it, more especially perhaps if he
knows that the man behind it is unsophisticated,
and cannot be depended upon to obey the
ordinary rules, that he has no deep design or
artful scheme in the background, but just one
idea&mdash;to keep his point always there, like a
sentry at his post.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put shortly, my advice amounts to this:&mdash;Defend
yourself by retreating; threaten by offering
the point. Offering the point, that is to say
straightening the arm, is the attack of the incapable
fencer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By retreating you maintain the distance
between yourself and your opponent, and make
it difficult for him to get command of your blade
on a simulated attack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is only one other movement that I
should teach to a novice, who came to me for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
advice in these circumstances. I should tell
him&mdash;as he retires and straightens his arm&mdash;to
change the line occasionally; that is to say
to pass his point under his opponent&rsquo;s blade and
threaten him on the other side, in fact a simple
disengagement. It is the easiest thing in the
world to understand, and anyone, however little
he may be skilled in the art of fencing, can do
it with the greatest ease; the act of retiring
itself facilitates the execution of the movement.
An hour&rsquo;s practice will make him familiar with
this change of line, which as I remarked just
now answers the double purpose of attack and
defence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should make my pupil repeat this very
simple performance over and over again, instructing
him to straighten his arm, sometimes
with his point held high on a level with the
chest, attacking the high lines, sometimes with
the point lowered, attacking the low lines. You
understand of course what is meant by the high
and low lines. It is the A&mdash;B&mdash;C of fencing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Notice that my lesson is simplified to a
degree that is almost ludicrous. I dissect every
movement and explain how the parts are put
together, being particularly careful to avoid the
use of technical terms, for my imaginary pupil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
is supposed to be completely ignorant, and he
would be hopelessly puzzled by them. If on the
other hand he happens to have some smattering
of knowledge he will appreciate more fully and
derive all the more benefit from the lesson thus
reduced to its simplest expression.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;You say nothing,&rdquo; remarked one of my
hearers, &ldquo;about the movement, which consists
in reversing the lunge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I answered; &ldquo;because I believe that
this device, which is only proper in certain
exceptional circumstances, is likely to prove
very dangerous if it is employed at the wrong
moment or at random. If it does not come off,
you are left without defence at your opponent&rsquo;s
mercy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To put the matter shortly:&mdash;if you adopt
my plan, you retire and at the same moment
offer your point either with a straight thrust or
with a disengagement; then you immediately
recover your guard and bring your forearm
back to its original position. Whether your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
thrust has succeeded or not, you are always
provided with a sound defence, you are set
firmly on your legs, your balance is undisturbed,
and upon your opponent&rsquo;s advance you can
repeat the process again and again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now suppose that you decide to lunge to
the rear; that is to say, to reverse the lunge by
throwing the left leg back to its full extent and
dropping the body, without moving the right
foot; well, when will you do this and how?</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are not an expert. What secret instinct
will inform you that the opportune moment has
come for executing this manoeuvre? For after
you have executed it, you must recover, and
recover smartly, if you are to regain your guard;
no easy matter, I assure you. In attempting to
perform a movement so complicated, you with
your want of experience can hardly fail to be
thrown into disorder, to the great advantage of
your adversary, who will seize the opportunity
to press you briskly and get command of your
blade.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even supposing that you escape from this
danger, you cannot go on repeating the process
continually; you cannot repeat it indifferently
on every attack, or on every semblance of an
attack that is made upon you. You must judge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
your opportunity. Now fencing judgment, especially
in a duel, implies knowledge, and remember
we are arguing on the assumption that you
are ignorant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For these reasons I should never think of
recommending the lunge to the rear to anyone
who has not acquired some familiarity with his
weapon.</p>

<h3>VIII.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;If we now turn from the man whose only
chance lies in his getting a rule of thumb to
work by to the man who is more or less used
to fencing, the case is different. The scope of
the lesson is enlarged. The pupil knows a few
words of the language, we must try to turn his
knowledge to account.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My advice to him would be:&mdash;In the first
place, take the same guard as that already
indicated; but make a little play with your
point, by changing the line occasionally from
inside to outside and so on, in order to bother
your opponent. Make a show of attacking now
and then, in order to recover any ground that
you may have lost by retreating. But be very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
careful never on any account to attack in real
earnest. You must be doubly strong and doubly
sure of all your movements to enable you to
attack without getting out of your depth, and
perhaps throwing yourself away in a moment
of inadvertence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then I should go on to say:&mdash;Sometimes,
but always accompanying the movement
with a short step to the rear, make a parry of
counter quarte and circle, a sweeping parry
which cuts all the lines, and is bound to find
the blade somewhere. Come back to your first
position at once, holding your point well in
front of your body. Then if you find that your
opponent means to develope his attack fully,
and that his point is directed high, throw your
left foot back boldly, remembering to drop your
head and body at the same moment, in order to
avoid the point which would otherwise strike
you in the upper part of the chest or in the
face. Above all, recover as smartly as you can
by springing quickly to the rear, so as to regain
your defensive position before your adversary,
if he has avoided or parried your thrust, can
take advantage of his opportunity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But once more I must caution you that
this sort of thing requires such training and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
judgment as I should not expect anyone to
possess who has not by regular practice made
himself thoroughly at home with the sword.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>IX.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;We are allowed to criticise, I believe,&rdquo;
remarked the Comte de C. after a pause which
followed these remarks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By all means,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;I not only allow
but invite criticism. In working out an idea,
I may very likely neglect some side of it that
ought not to be passed over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you seem to me inconsistent. You
said the other day, and I quite agreed with
you:&mdash;&lsquo;The first and fundamental rule of fencing
is to parry;&rsquo; and now you tell us on the contrary
not to attempt to parry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is fair criticism,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;but
I do not admit the inconsistency. You will
remember that we were then talking of scientific
fencing, that is to say of the systematic study
of swordsmanship. But that has nothing to do
with the present question. The whole art of
fencing cannot be learnt in three or four hours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me give you an analogy, for an analogy
often serves to put an argument simply.
Two men are on a sinking ship; one of them
knows how to swim, the other only knows how
to go to the bottom and stay there. Meanwhile
the danger is immediate. Would you
say to the man who cannot swim a stroke:&mdash;&lsquo;Look
here, this is the way to swim; you
move your arms like this, and at the same
time you move your legs like that&rsquo;? Do you
mean to tell me that he will be able to put
into practice straight away what you have just
shown him? Or do you suppose, that thanks
to your demonstration he will be able to swim
when he finds himself in the water? No, of
course you are not so foolish as to suppose
anything of the sort. You would of course
tell him to catch hold of something or other,
anything&mdash;a spar, an oar, or a plank, and to
support himself on it as best he can; that is
his only chance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my case is on all fours with that.
My pupil is in imminent peril of his life. My
business is to give him the spar or the plank,
which may serve to keep him afloat. I don&rsquo;t
bother about teaching him to swim.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<h3>X.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Of course there is nothing to prevent one
from showing one or two parries to the novice
who has to fight a duel at short notice. But
the only parries that would be of any use to
him are the comprehensive and rather complicated
parries, which sweep through all the
lines. What would be the result?</p>

<p>&ldquo;His parries would be weak, undecided,
and slow. Instead of tripping neatly round
the blade, they would labour painfully after it
in wide circles. To deceive them would be
the merest child&rsquo;s play, and the poor novice,
encountering nothing but empty air, would let
his blade fly into space, and send his arm after
it, leaving himself completely exposed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even supposing that his opponent does not
take advantage of his opportunity, the novice
realises how helpless he is, and racks his brains
for some device to avoid the danger when he is
again attacked. Then he does not know what
to do, what not to do; he loses his head and
is seized with panic; he strikes wildly at his
opponent&rsquo;s blade, as a drowning man strikes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
wildly at the water, and nothing remains to be
done but to wait for the finishing thrust, or to
rush blindly at his opponent, with the probability
that he will run upon his point. Those
are my reasons for not attempting to teach
an untutored novice things which he cannot
possibly perform.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, on the other hand, consider in detail
the measures that I do put at his disposal.
By retiring he evades the point. Evading the
point, by drawing the body back or by springing
to the rear, may not be the same thing as
parrying, but it amounts to much the same in
the end, since you retire out of range and are
not hit. Or if you are hit, at the worst you can
be only lightly touched, because by retiring you
make your opponent lose the ground which he
reckoned on gaining by his attack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Moreover when he sees that you straighten
your arm every time on the chance of reaching
him, he dare not lunge out recklessly. If he
does, you have at least a chance of hitting
him,&mdash;by a fluke no doubt, but I suppose you
do not much mind that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<h3>XI.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;There is one last objection that I will
anticipate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, I may be asked, becomes of your
scheme of defence, if, the moment that the
novice extends his sword at a venture, the
adversary engages it?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Without a doubt that is what he ought to
do, and what he will do, as I shall presently
explain. But you do not imagine, I suppose,
that a man completely ignorant of the use of
his weapon, who goes to a professor for advice
on the eve of an encounter, can hope to come
away comforted with the assurance that he has
learnt the whole art of how to hit his opponent
without being touched himself? That, I fancy,
would be too convenient. It would be better
then to study the art of not learning to fence,
instead of spending months and years in studying
the art of fencing. Ignorance would indeed
be bliss and wisdom folly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The man who has not learnt the use of
the weapon to which he entrusts his life, may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
think himself lucky if he can lessen the chances,
to which he is exposed, of a fatal issue. The
master can hope to accomplish nothing more
than to give his pupil some confidence, and
show him the only course that can be commended
by common sense and at the same
time furnishes some sort of defence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the novice does what he is told he will,
I repeat, put difficulties and dangers in the way
of his opponent; he will force him to act with
caution, he will keep him at long range, and
compel him to shift his ground when he attacks.
In shifting his ground he may, either through
carelessness or in the excitement of the moment,
leave himself uncovered, and give an opening
to the point that is continually directed at him.
But I do not for a moment suppose that a
wary and experienced fencer, who keeps his
head cool, will not easily defeat such elementary
strategy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may tell your pupil to be prudent, you
may tell him to be calm and resolute, but now
or never you should add the pious wish &lsquo;Heaven
help you&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<h3>XII.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;May I ask one more question?&rdquo; said one
of my friends. &ldquo;I have often heard it said that
if you don&rsquo;t know much about fencing the best
thing to do is, as soon as you come on guard, to
make a sudden rush at the other man before he
has time to collect himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;if you wish to make sure
of being incurably spitted, that is the most infallible
way to set about it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The seconds, before giving the signal to
begin, have just asked your opponent if he is
ready. Is it likely that he will allow himself
to be rushed, or to be victimised by such a
transparent piece of bluff?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it not much more likely that he will
have been told to look out for a surprise attack?
One of two things,&mdash;either the man who confronts
you is a skilful fencer, in which case he
will not want you to give him time to collect
himself, but will be quite capable of taking his
own time; or his ignorance of fencing is on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
par with yours, and then it is a toss up. It
follows that if this desperate plan of attack is
chosen, because it is thought likely to succeed,
it is absurd. If however it is chosen, because
the man who chooses it is of a restive impatient
disposition, one who cannot wait and for whom
cool defensive tactics are an impossibility, the
case is different.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All that one can say to the pupil, whose
temper is such that he cannot play a waiting
game, is something of this sort:&mdash;Trust your
instinct, be guided by your natural impulse.
You quite understand that by acting as you
propose you run a greater risk; for your attack
is delivered at random, you are embarking on
a wild and hazardous speculation. Your only
chance of success, as you yourself admit, is that
you may, by suddenly and violently letting yourself
go for all you are worth, take your opponent
by surprise and put him off his parry. I can
only give you one word of advice. Before letting
yourself go, try at any rate to beat the other
man&rsquo;s sword out of line in any way you can.
Knock it up or down, to one side or the other;
as soon as you have made your beat, let yourself
go straight, without the least hesitation. By this
means you will avoid an interchange of hits or a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
stop thrust. But I warn you this is not so easy
as it sounds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Possibly, where so much depends on luck
and accident, you may bring off your hit. But if
you are the wounded man, you will be wounded
with a vengeance, for you will probably run on
the sword up to the hilt,&mdash;a trifling consideration,
which is perhaps worth taking into account.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This plan in fact can never be recommended;
it involves not only too many risks,
but risks that are too serious and too certain.
I will show you presently in greater detail why
this is so, when we look at the question from the
other side, from the point of view of a fencer
more or less skilful, who is opposed to a novice
ignorant of swordsmanship but a determined
natural fighter, who is thoroughly roused by a
keen sense of danger.</p>

<h3>XIII.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;The case we shall consider next will be the
reverse of this. By reversing the position we
shall hear what is to be said on both sides, and
we shall then have considered from every point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
of view, the probabilities of victory or defeat,
which are likely to occur in a duel. We will
leave that for to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so we broke up.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>The real thing.</i></p>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>We have now to examine the duel with
swords from a different point of view.
The ignorant and inexperienced fencer, trying at
the last moment to find a desperate remedy for
a desperate state of affairs, may be dismissed, and
we have now to consider the case of combatants
who are more or less evenly matched, and who
are fighting in deadly earnest. For as I have
already said, a duel generally equalises the forces
on either side, except when a skilful and resolute
swordsman meets a clumsy hesitating duffer, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
when a cool head is opposed to that rash and
furious bluster which more often than not leads
a man to his destruction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;First and foremost, your invariable rule
must be:&mdash;Distrust your enemy; never be overconfident.
I cannot too often repeat that the
unexpected always turns up just when you are
least prepared for it. It is this glorious uncertainty
that to my mind makes fighting with
swords the only sort of duelling that is fair and
sportsmanlike, the only sort in which energy,
courage, and resolution always give some chance
to the weaker combatant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a duel fought with pistols, what a
wretched rôle is assigned to the combatants.
Energy is of no use, courage of no value; you
stand up like a target to be shot at, without any
possibility of defence. Courage and cowardice
meet on equal terms; the feeblest and most
spiritless sneak may succeed in defeating the
most determined courage and the manliest
energy. A finger presses a trigger, and the
thing is done. Duelling with pistols has always
seemed to me a monstrous practice. I am delighted
to see it disappearing from our manners,
and going more and more out of fashion every
day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;To return to my subject,&mdash;there are certain
elementary principles of self-defence, from which
the prudent fencer ought never to depart; principles
of such universal application, that they
may be considered the foundation on which is
based all serious fighting, which is conducted
with any sort of method.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As soon as the second who undertakes to
start the proceedings has put you on guard, and
steps back, leaving you at liberty to set to, you
should immediately take two or three paces to
the rear, before your opponent can realise or
anticipate what you are about. By this means
you at once put yourself out of range, and out
of danger either from a surprise or from one of
those blind and frantic rushes, to which, as we
have seen, some men are apt to pin their faith.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;But,&rdquo; exclaimed one of my hearers, not
altogether seriously, &ldquo;if your opponent does
the same thing, you will find yourselves at a
range more suitable for pistol practice than
for sword-play.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; I replied, taking him seriously,
&ldquo;you have three advantages for one,&mdash;surely
a substantial gain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the first place, if the same idea has
occurred to your opponent as to you, or if
the same advice has been given to you both,
the advice is the more likely to be sound.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the second place, his quick strategic
movement to the rear tells you very plainly
that he too has no fancy for a surprise, or for
that rough and tumble style of fighting which
reduces sword-play to a sort of fisticuffs. You
are able to make up your mind at once that he
is not that sort of fighter, and that his attacks
will be prudent and well considered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the third place, the brief pause gives
you a moment or two to pull yourself together
and get steady, to take a good look at
your opponent&rsquo;s point, and get over that first
involuntary sensation, that momentary chill,
which no one, not even the bravest of us, ever
fails to experience. It also gives you time
to run your eye over your antagonist, and
by noting how he stands, how he holds his
sword, in a word how he shapes, to look the
situation in the face and settle your plan of
campaign.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That, I think you will admit, is something
gained, even if you have to stand for a few
seconds at a range which, as you say, seems
more suitable for pistol practice.</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Have you never observed how all animals,
from the most insignificant creatures up to the
most savage beasts, set about fighting? Look
at two cocks in a back-yard or two bulls in a
field. Notice how they skirmish and spar before
really letting themselves go; notice the wicked
glitter of their eyes as they intently watch for
an opening, where they will presently plant their
most telling blow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What teaches them not to rush at each
other&rsquo;s throat in blind fury? Why, simply instinct,
the science of self-preservation which is
common to every living thing; and common
instinct should teach you the same lesson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will easily realise how completely you
upset or at least disturb the calculations of the
man who is clinging to advice of this kind:&mdash;&lsquo;The
moment you are on guard,&mdash;lunge, before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
your opponent has time to collect himself&rsquo;; or
of the man, whose one idea is to make a wild
and indiscriminate charge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such men, however lacking they may be
in brains, can hardly fail to perceive that the
distance between you and them makes a surprise
impracticable. If they do attempt it, their
movements will be disconcerted; they will give
themselves away, and may probably run upon
your point if you hold it straight before you, or
in any case they must give you time to see them
coming. You may be attacked no doubt, and
attacked furiously, but you will not be surprised.</p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;When you have placed yourself out of
range you remain free to choose your next
move. If your opponent now seems inclined
to shorten the distance between you, wait for
him without breaking ground. He is compelled
to advance, and therefore is at a disadvantage;
for if he exposes himself, you are ready for him;
you do your best to harass his advance, you
watch your opportunity, and whatever movement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
he makes you let him see that he is continually
threatened by your point. He cannot help
giving you notice of his attack; you see what
is coming, and are able to take your measures
accordingly. The way he manages his advance,
and the accompanying movements of his point,
hand, and arm, are sure signs by which you can
tell how much or how little he knows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If on the other hand he stands on the
defensive and seems inclined to wait for your
attack, you may advance cautiously, with short
steps, keeping your legs well under you and
your body well balanced, levelling your point
now at his eyes, now at his chest;&mdash;for you
must be careful to guard against the dangers
that I have just mentioned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In order to counteract, or at least to lessen
the disadvantage to which you are exposed on
your advance, you must occupy your opponent&rsquo;s
attention by continually threatening him in the
different lines; for by compelling him to protect
himself you prevent him from attacking you,
and meanwhile little by little you gain ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a good plan to feint a serious attack
in order to compel him to show his hand, and to
find out whether he means to rely on a parry, or
if he will simply straighten his arm. But you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
must be very sure of yourself, and have complete
control of your movements, or you will very
likely disclose your own plans by some involuntary
and incautious gesture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All that I have said applies with equal
force to good and bad fencers, to the expert as
well as to the novice. Prudence and self-control
are more than half the battle. To these must
be added science, which enables you to deceive
your opponent by deluding him as to your real
object, while you compel him unwillingly to
betray himself.</p>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; I said, interrupting myself, &ldquo;that
you find me tolerably intelligible and that you
follow the connection between the successive
steps of my argument?&rdquo;</p>

<p>My audience with one voice assured me that
I was perfectly intelligible, and that they were
following me with the greatest interest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I may be a trifle long-winded in dealing
with these points, but please remember that
after pointing out a danger or giving a piece
of advice, I have to show how the danger may
be met, by explaining the answering move.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;To proceed,&mdash;whichever of you has made
the first advance, you are now within striking
distance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you are absolutely ignorant of sword-play,
like the unfortunate duellist whose case
we were considering last night, I have already
told you what in my opinion you can do, or at
least may attempt to do. I have nothing more
to say on that head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The opponents that we now have in view
are supposed to have a knowledge of the use of
weapons. It follows that the questions to be
considered will naturally resemble those that we
have already discussed when talking of theoretical
sword-play and more particularly of the
assault. The only difference is the difference
between a sham fight and a real fight, the difference
between a muzzled foil and an unmuzzled
sword. Besides that, in an assault you are
governed by conventional restrictions clearly defined
and well understood; you do not attempt
to hit your opponent except in accordance with
the rules; you wear a mask and a jacket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the mistakes which you are most
anxious to avoid in an assault are the very
things that you try to turn to account in a fight,
in order to perplex your opponent and spoil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
his game. For fencing, if the professors will
allow me to say so, is perhaps the one art in
which mistakes may upon occasion prove of the
greatest possible advantage to him who makes
them. Otherwise it would be mere bookwork,
to be learnt more or less thoroughly, and the
man who knew his book completely would have
nothing to fear; but to my mind it is nothing
of the sort. No knowledge of fencing can make
a man invulnerable. If anyone imagines that
he is an exception to the rule he betrays a
singularly misplaced confidence in his own
powers,&mdash;a very dangerous error.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But ought we to condemn swordsmanship
on that account? My own opinion is that this
uncertainty is the great beauty of the sword, the
one feature that distinguishes it as the only
weapon for a fair fight; for even the weakest
player has his opportunity, his lucky moments,
his strokes of fortune, which must always prevent
the duel from degenerating into simple butchery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If fencing were an exact science, if you
knew, that as sure as two and two make four,
you could certainly hit your man, and that he
as certainly could not hit you, how could you
in common honesty cross swords with him?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid that I have been wandering
somewhat from my text; but this digression,
though it may at first sight seem out of place,
still when one comes to consider it is very closely
connected with our subject. For it serves to
emphasise once more the fact that, in spite of
every probability, luck may always turn the
scale in favour of the other side, and to remind
you that you cannot attach too much importance
to the most minute particulars of your defence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Habitual mistrust is one of the most
necessary requirements for this complicated
art. Put in another way it is the careful study
of the enemy whom you have to face. The
mistrust that marks the wary, calculating player,
not only preserves him from danger but creates
dangers for his opponent.</p>

<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;I was saying the other day that I did not
believe in secret thrusts, and that the thrusts
that have received this absurd misnomer are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
nothing but strokes that are not generally recognised
by the ordinary rules of fencing. Strip
them of their imaginary terrors, and far from
being dangerous to you they become more than
a little dangerous for the man who attempts
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To describe them, we need not distinguish
more than two sorts,&mdash;methods of attack, and
methods of evading or dodging an opponent&rsquo;s
attack. These tricks are all very much of the
same character. Take this for an example:&mdash;lunge
as though you were making a simple
attack, then suddenly draw your arm back to
make your opponent parry in the air, throw
yourself out of line and let drive, hitting him in
the ribs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or again:&mdash;after a false attack, dodge by
stooping low to avoid the parry and riposte, and
hit your opponent in the low lines. The sudden
disappearance of your body will probably astonish
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some men delight in charging at you with
a shout, at the same time drawing back their
arm to avoid your parry. This strange war-cry
occasionally has the effect of causing a moment&rsquo;s
involuntary pause, of which they take advantage
to drive their point home anyhow and anywhere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Others again, when the blades are engaged
in tierce, suddenly bring their left foot to the
front, at the same time swinging the body
round, left shoulder forward and out of line
with your point.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If on the other hand these strokes, which
if not foul are decidedly irregular, are employed
to meet an attack, the same thing is done with
slight variations. Suppose I deliver an attack;
my opponent, instead of parrying, springs aside
out of line. Sword and body vanish; the target
has moved away; my attack loses itself in
space, and I am hit by a flank movement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or again, he ducks suddenly, supporting
himself on his free hand, and allows my point
to pass harmlessly over his head, while at the
same time he hits me somewhere,&mdash;in the low
lines of course.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or again, he seizes my blade in tierce,
swings the left foot round to the front, suddenly
arrives at close quarters, and before I have time
either to retreat or to recover my guard, stabs
me by drawing back or dropping his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I might extend this list of examples indefinitely,
but you see that all these strokes are
contrived on the same plan, and only differ from
each other in unimportant details. It needs no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
argument to prove how completely the man
who resorts to such tactics gives himself away
if they are unsuccessful, for in order to make
them really formidable there must be no hanging
back,&mdash;you must let yourself go without the
least reserve.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>VIII.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;But surely,&rdquo; someone objected, &ldquo;in the
hands of a skilful swordsman they would be
doubly dangerous?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That contingency,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;is worth considering,
but a skilful swordsman would be very
unlikely to resort to such methods. Why should
he? If his opponent is a duffer, he has no need
to be so tricky. If on the other hand his opponent
is a cool-headed fencer, as skilful as
himself, he knows the penalty of failure too
well to make the attempt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I need hardly tell you,&mdash;though I believe
I have mentioned the fact already,&mdash;that when
you attack you ought to be particularly careful
not to let yourself go so completely that you
cannot recover your defensive position, if your
attack fails.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;All these remarks illustrate how necessary it
is to distrust your enemy, to approach a strange
antagonist with caution, and always keep him
at a distance. By retreating the moment you
come on guard you have already provided
against a surprise and against wild rushes.
When you are within range, take my advice
and do not join blades, and always, as much
as possible, avoid coming to such close quarters
that your opponent can reach you without breaking
ground. But do not misunderstand me when
I tell you not to join blades. I do not mean
that you are never to cover yourself, and never
to allow the blades to meet; that would be a
mistake. All that I mean is that you should
take care never to allow your opponent to hold
your blade. By playing light and refusing a
proffered engagement you put a stop to all
forcing strokes,&mdash;<i>croisés</i>, beats, binds, <i>flanconnade</i>,&mdash;which
are the most dangerous of all
strokes, because they are the most certain. I
call them certain, because by holding your
blade prisoner they control it forcibly, and
make a stop thrust or an exchange of hits
impossible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<h3>IX.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;There are of course several ways of dealing
with a man who refuses to engage, but they are
difficult and require much practice. It generally
happens that your refusal disconcerts your
opponent. He has no definite point to start
from, he hesitates, and his hesitation retards
his attack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If his attack is complicated, you may venture
on a stop thrust, offered with caution and
accompanied by a short step to the rear; and
you worry, and annoy, and wear him out to the
best of your ability.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If his attack is simple, he will be afraid
of an exchange of hits; and the more skilful
he is, the more cautious you will find him; and
as I said when speaking of the assault, you may
lessen the danger of a simple attack by a brisk
retreat to a greater or less distance, as the case
may be. By this means you parry more easily,
you increase the distance to be traversed, and
you counteract the rapidity of the attack by two
methods of defence instead of one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you are hit, the wound is slight, or at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
all events much less severe than it would have
been, if you had tried to parry without breaking
ground. If on the other hand your parry is
successful, you have escaped the danger of a
<i>corps à corps</i>, and are in a better position for
delivering your riposte.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So much for the defence, now let us suppose
that you are the attacking party. You attack,
either because you place more reliance on the
quickness of your hand than on the certainty
of your riposte, or because your opponent, by
confining himself to defensive tactics, compels
you to do so. You must be doubly cautious
now.</p>

<h3>X.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;If it is important, as I have just now
pointed out, to avoid engaging blades when you
are acting on the defensive, in order to protect
yourself from what may be called attacks on
the sword, it is obviously of equal importance
never to attack without first attempting to
master your opponent&rsquo;s <i>fort</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eschew feints;&mdash;I have shown you how
dangerous they are&mdash;therefore be content with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
direct attacks, prefacing them with an engagement
in <i>carte</i> or <i>tierce</i>, or with a pressure, or a
beat, light or heavy, accordingly as you wish
to draw your opponent to one line or another.
Your object will be gained more easily, if he
is willing to join blades.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If on the other hand he is unwilling to do
so, you must by force or fraud bring him to an
engagement, and you should never finish your
attack until you have succeeded in finding his
blade; unless in his efforts to elude you he
leaves himself completely exposed. When that
happens a straight thrust is a certainty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What you have most to fear is a stop
thrust, the straightening of your opponent&rsquo;s
arm on your preparation or advance. This is
generally a favourite stroke with those who
deliberately stand on the defensive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In nine cases out of ten the refusal to join
blades may be successfully met by a simulated
attack, if it is well marked. Either your opponent
attempts to parry, or he straightens his
arm; whereupon you immediately engage his
blade, and drive your attack home, without
quitting his blade, and above all without any
feint.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>

<h3>XI.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;It is evidently impossible to enumerate in
the course of conversation all the situations that
may occur, or to describe all the traps that you
may set for your opponent or that he may set
for you. These things are matters of instinct
and inspiration, the happy thoughts of the moment,
and depend on character and individual
temperament, physical and moral. The art of
fighting cannot of course be learnt in a day;
it grows upon you gradually, as you learn by
experience to combine the various elements
scientifically into a well-ordered whole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Picture for yourselves two men fighting.&mdash;You
see them at one moment standing their full
height, the next bent double, swerving to right
and left, colliding violently, and entangled in a
furious encounter; suddenly they break away,
recoiling from each other with a bound, rest for
a moment, panting and glaring, till suddenly
they renew the struggle. Do you suppose that
all these intricate evolutions, and the subtle
application of muscular force that they imply,
can be systematically analysed and taught? Of
course not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;In every art proficiency can only be obtained
by persistent and intelligent application.
Practice alone makes perfect. It is by studying
combinations, by trying to adapt the means at
his disposal to the object in view, that the artist
tests the limits of his art and discovers its hidden
secrets, fashions it at will, and makes it his
obedient slave.</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;These remarks would not be complete, if
I failed to caution you against a very pernicious
habit, which one is apt to contract in the fencing-room,
and which in a duel may easily lead to a
fatal issue. I mean the habit of stopping after
you have made a hit, instead of immediately
recovering your guard and putting yourself out
of distance. Never forget this important point;
if you do, you may after wounding your opponent
receive a mortal wound, for which you will
have only yourself to blame.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every fencer knows how commonly it
happens in an assault, that a man ripostes
automatically after he is hit, and strikes his
opponent almost simultaneously, especially when
the latter has not taken the trouble to attend
strictly to his recovery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remember that a sword-thrust, even though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
it be mortal, does not take effect immediately.
There is always a momentary interval before
the wounded man falters, or drops his sword, or
falls to the ground unconscious. The moment
you think you have made a hit,&mdash;for you may
be mistaken,&mdash;get back as smartly as you can,
and be ready to go on fighting.</p>

<h3>XII.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I added after a short pause, &ldquo;nothing
else occurs to me in the way of general advice,
which I can commend to your notice. When
the time for actual fighting arrives, your attention
must be concentrated on the important
points, and these may be summed up in two or
three words:&mdash;self-reliance, well-judged caution,
restrained and well-timed energy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have given us most excellent advice,&rdquo;
exclaimed the Comte de C. &ldquo;If one could only
think of it all at the critical moment, one would
be well provided.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think of only half of it,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;and
you will not do so badly,&mdash;there are so many
men who cannot think at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<h3>XIII.</h3>

<p>The next day we all met as usual in the
smoking-room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; someone asked me, &ldquo;what are you
going to talk about to-night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;my subject is exhausted,
I have told you all I know, or at any
rate all that I think worth knowing.&rdquo;</p>

will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
